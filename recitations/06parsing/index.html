<h2>How to approach assignment 4</h2>
<p>
You will be more successful on the next assignment if you divide the work up
evenly between the two partners and set things up so both can make progress
immediately. In particular, you don't want to wait on implementing the fault
injection/mutation part of the assignment, because it's about half the work all
by itself. The natural interface between parsing and fault injection is the
design of the AST.  If your group can arrive at a good AST design early, then
one partner can work on producing the AST as an output and the other can work
on fault injection that uses it as an input.
</p>

<h2>Interpreting an expression as AST</h2>

<p>
Let's draw an AST for an example rule written in the critter language. Here is the rule:
</p>

<pre>
mem[8] mod (6 + 7 + 11) = 0 and 1 < mem[2] --> mem[2] := 5 mem[1+mem[3]] := 2 + ahead[4] left
</pre>

<p>
Here is a reasonable way to represent it as an abstract syntax tree:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="rec06/example.png">
</div>

<p>
It might be useful see <a href="rec06/example.dot">the DOT source file that generated this diagram</a>.
It can be viewed using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>, which is a useful tool
to know about.
</p>

<p>
Notice that we created nodes called "command" and "updates" that aren't in the concrete
syntax, but are meaningful for the critter language.
</p>

<h2>Parsing example: s-expressions</h2>
<p>
The second high-level programming language, Lisp, is written using
<b>s-expressions</b>, introduced by John McCarthy around 1959. An s-expression
uses parentheses to denote the application of a function, in prefix syntax.
For example, the expression 2+3 would be written as (+ 2 3) in Lisp. The tokens
"+", "2", and "3" are all considered identifiers.
</p> 

<h3>A grammar for s-expressions</h3>

We use "id" to represent an identifier token. The start symbol is S.

<pre>
S → id | ( L )
L → S L | ε
</pre>

Note that this syntax permits empty s-expressions such as <code>()</code>. If these are not desired, the syntax
for nonterminal L can be adjusted:

<pre>
L → S L | S
</pre>

<h3>AST for s-expressions</h3>
<p>
The abstract syntax tree need not follow the parse tree closely. In the case of s-expression, there are really
two kinds of expressions: identifiers and applications. We can capture this idea by declaring two classes that
implement a common <code>Node</code> interface:

<pre>
interface Node {
    ...
}
class Id implements Node {
    String name;
}
class App implements Node {
    List&lt;Node&gt; children;
}
</pre>

<p>
So an s-expression such as <code>(+ (* 2 3) 4 )</code> produces the following
AST, where all non-leaf nodes represent function applications.
</p>

</div>

<h2>Parsing s-expressions</h2>

<p>
We declare a method for each nonterminal, with a type appropriate for representing what
that nonterminal corresponds to. One trick we can use is to rewrite the L nonterminal using
EBNF syntax in which a regular expression is used on the right-hand side:
</p>
<pre>
L → S<sup>*</sup>
</pre>
<p>This rule suggests implementing the parsing of L as a loop.

<pre class=load>
<a href="rec06/SExp.java">SExp.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
This parsing code is simple and efficient.

CS 2112 Morale Calibration Session
Tuesday October 23, 7:30pm, Gates 310

Olivia and Ben will discuss a variety of topics. This discussion is geared toward students who may be on the fence about dropping the course, are having a hard time understanding if they are doing OK, or are having a hard time establishing connections in CS 2112. This discussion will not be "I received a score of X, Y, and Z, am I going to get an A?" Rather, as prior 2112 students and now-veteran CS students, Olivia and Ben will discuss things such as
 
- the fallacy of the 0-100 grading system as employed by most high schools
- what it means to struggle in CS 2112, as well as in CS at Cornell in general
- tactics for success in this and any course
- teambuilding exercises (yes, we as a class ARE a team!)
- and more
 
The talk is designed to give you an opportunity to hear from somebody who went through the same pain as you, both in adjusting to college life as well as CS 2112. We understand that 2112 is a challenging course. We felt this was an excellent opportunity to give some perspective you would otherwise not receive until going through it yourself.
 
Requirements for attendance: If you attend this session, you must be courteous and unassuming. The goal is to enable you as a student to get a little forward perspective on the years to come in a safe atmosphere. Asking other students what their scores are or why they are attending is unacceptable.

- be nice
- be ready to hear about alternative perspectives and how what you say or do could be interpreted
- if another student asks a question you think is silly, conceal your amusement
- be conscientious
 
Basically, be the considerate individuals you already are! Just please, please, PLEASE understand the importance of making this a safe atmosphere for everybody involved.
 
Thank you very much Olivia and Ben, we hope to see you all there!

A <b>graph</b> is a highly useful mathematical abstraction. A graph consists of
a set of <b>nodes</b> (also called <b>vertices</b>) and a set of <b>edges</b>
connecting those vertices. There are two main kinds
of graphs: <b>undirected graphs</b> and <b>directed graphs</b>. In a directed graph
(sometimes abbreviated as <b>digraph</b>), the edges are
directed: that is, they have a direction, proceeding from a
<b>source</b> vertex to a <b>sink</b> (or <b>destination</b>) vertex.
The sink vertex is a <b>successor</b> of the source, and the the source is
a <b>predecessor</b> of the sink.  In undirected graphs, the edges are symmetrical.

<h2>Uses of graphs</h2>
<p>
Graphs are a highly useful abstraction in computer science because so many
important problems can be expressed in terms of graphs. We have already seen a
number of graph structures: for example, the objects in a running program form
a directed graph in which the vertices are objects and references between
objects are edges. To implement <b>automatic garbage collection</b> (which
discards unused objects), the language implementation uses a algorithm for
<b>graph reachability</b>.
</p>
<p>
Other examples of graphs, many of which we've seen, include:
<ul class=bullets>
<li>
states of games and puzzles, which are vertices connected by edges that are
the legal moves in the game,
</li><li>
state machines, where the states are vertices and the transitions between states
are edges,
</li>
<li>
road maps, where the vertices are intersections or points along the road and edges
are roads connecting those points,
</li>
<li>
scheduling problems, where vertices represent events to be scheduled and edges might
represent events that cannot be scheduled together, or, depending on the problem,
edges that <em>must</em> be scheduled together,
</li>
<li>
and in fact, any binary relation \(ρ\) can be viewed as a directed graph in which
the relationship \((x~ρ~y)\) corresponds to an edge from vertex \(x\) to vertex \(y\).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What is the value of having a common mathematical abstraction like graphs?
One payoff is that we can develop algorithms that work on graphs in general.
Once we realize we can express a problem in terms of graphs,
we can consult a very large toolbox of efficient graph algorithms, rather than
trying to invent a new algorithm for the specific domain of interest.
</p>
<p>
There are many computational problems over graphs that are not known to
be solvable in any reasonable amount of time. In particular, there is a large class of problems
known as the <b>NP complete problems</b> that are not known to be efficiently solvable, but
are known to be equivalent in complexity. If we could give an efficient algorithm for solving
any one of them, then we would have efficient algorithms for all of them.
</p>

<h2>Vertices and edges</h2>
<p>
A graph consists of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E.
If the graph is directed, the edges E are a set of ordered
pairs (u,v) representing an edge with source
vertex u and sink vertex v. When drawing graphs, this is usually
represented as an arrow from u to v.
</p>

<p>If the graph is undirected, then the edges are a set of sets of <em>unordered</em>
pairs {u,v}. Alternatively, we can model an undirected graph as a directed graph
with edges in both directions; i.e., if (u,v) &isin; E,
then (v,u) &isin; E also. When drawing graphs, this is usually
represented as a line between u and v without an arrowhead.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, edges from a vertex to itself or multiple edges between the same
pair of vertices may be permitted. But usually the default is <em>not</em> to allow
these things unless explicly stated otherwise.
</p>

<h2>Adjacency and degree</h2>
<p>
Two vertices v and w are <b>adjacent</b> if they are connected
by an edge. The <b>degree</b> of a vertex is the total number of adjacent 
vertices. In a directed graph, we can distinguish between outgoing and incoming
edges. The <b>out-degree</b> of a vertex is the number of outgoing edges and
the <b>in-degree</b> is the number of incoming edgs.
</p>

<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>The real value of graphs is obtained when we can use them to organize
information.  Both edges and vertices of graphs can have <b>labels</b> that
carry meaning about an entity represented by a vertex or about the relationship
between two entities represented by an edge. For example, we might encode
information about the population of cities and distances between them
as an undirected labeled graph:
</p>
<div class=figure>
<img src="cities.png" />
</div>
<p>
Here, the vertices are labeled with a pair containing the name of the city and
its population, and the edges are labeled with the distance between the cities.
</p>
<p>A graph in which the edges are labeled with numbers is called a <b>weighted graph</b>.
Of course, the labels do not have to represent weight; they might stand for
distances, or the probability of transitioning from one state to
another, or the similarity between two vertices, etc.
</p>

<h2>Graph representations</h2>
<p>
There are several ways to represent graphs in a computer program.  Which
representation is best depends on the application.
For example, consider the following weighted directed graph with vertices {0,1,2,3}
and directed edges with edge weights shown:
</p>

<div class=figure>
<img src="rep_graph.png">
</div>

<h3>Adjacency matrix</h3>
<p>
An <b>adjacency matrix</b> represents a graph as a two-dimensional array.
Each vertex is assigned a distinct index in {0,1,...,|V|-1}. If
the graph is represented by the 2D array <code>m</code>, then the
edge (or lack thereof) from vertex <code>i</code> to vertex <code>j</code>
is recorded at <code>m[i][j]</code>.
</p>
<p>
The graph structure, ignoring the weights, can be represented by storing a boolean value at
each array index. A directed edge from i to j is represented by a true (T) value in location m[i][j].
If there is no edge there, the value is false.
For example, the edges in the example above are represented this matrix:
</p>
<div class=figure>
<table style="margin: 0 auto">
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th> <th>0</th> <th>1</th> <th>2</th> <th>3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>0</th> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1</th> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2</th> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3</th> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
More compact bit-level representations for the booleans are also possible.
</p>
<p>If there is some information associated with each edge, say a weight,
we store that information in the corresponding array entry:</p>
<div class=figure>
<table>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th> <th>0</th> <th>1</th> <th>2</th> <th>3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>0</th> <td>—</td> <td>10</td> <td>40</td> <td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1</th> <td>—</td> <td>—</td> <td>—</td> <td>–5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2</th> <td>—</td> <td>25</td> <td>20</td> <td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3</th> <td>—</td> <td>—</td> <td>—</td> <td>—</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
The space required by the adjacency matrix representation is O(V<sup>2</sup>),
so adjacency matrices can waste a lot of space if the number of edges |E| is
much smaller than O(V<sup>2</sup>). In particular, a graph with only O(V) edges
is said to be <b>sparse</b>. For example, graphs in which either the
in-degree or out-degree is bounded by a constant are sparse. Adjacency matrices
are not as wasteful when the graphs they represent are <b>dense</b> (i.e., not sparse).
</p>
<p>
The adjacency matrix representation is <em>time</em>-efficient for some
operations.  Testing whether there is an edge between two vertices can clearly
be done in constant time. However, finding all incoming edges to a given
vertex, or finding all outgoing edges, takes time proportional to the number
of vertices, even for sparse graphs.
</p>
<p>
Undirected graphs can also be represented with an adjacency matrix. The
matrix will be symmetric around its main diagonal; that is, m[i][j]=m[j][i].
</p>

<h3>Adjacency list representation</h3>
<p>
Since sparse graphs are quite common, the <b>adjacency list</b> representation is
often preferred. This representation keeps track of the outgoing edges from
each vertex, typically as a linked list. For example, the graph above might
be represented with the following data structure:
</p>

<div class=figure>
<img src="adjacency_list.png">
</div>

<p>
Adjacency lists are asymptotically space-efficient because they only use space
proportional to the number of vertices and the number of edges. We say that they
require O(V+E) space.
</p>
<p>
Finding the outgoing edges from a vertex is very efficient in the adjacency
list representation too; it requires time proportional to the number of outgoing
edges.  However, finding the incoming edges to a vertex is not efficient: it
requires scanning the entire data structure, requiring O(V+E) time.
</p>
<p>
When it is necessary to be able to walk forward on outgoing edges and backward
on incoming edges, a good approach is to maintain two adjacency lists,
one representing the graph as above and one corresponding to the <b>dual</b>
(or <b>transposed</b>) graph</b> in which all edges are reversed. That is,
there is a an edge (u,v) in the original graph if and only if there is an edge (v,u) in 
the transposed graph.  Of course, this invariant must be maintained between the
two adjacency list representations.
</p>
<p>
Testing whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j requires scanning
all the outgoing edges, taking O(V) time in the worse case. If this operation
needs to be fast, the linked list can be replaced with a hash table. For example,
we might implement the graph using this Java representation, which preserves
the asympotic space efficiency of adjacency lists while also supporting
queries for particular edges:
</p>
<div class=equation>
<code>
HashMap&lt;Vertex, HashMap&lt;Vertex, Edge&gt;&gt;
</code>
</div>
<h2>Paths and cycles</h2>
<p>
Following a series of edges from a starting vertex creates a <b>path</b>
through the graph, a sequence of alternating vertices and edges beginning and ending with a vertex (v<sub>0</sub>,e<sub>0</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub>)
where e<sub>i</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub>,v<sub>i+1</sub>) for all 0&le;i&le;n-1.
The <b>length</b> of the path is the number of edges (that is, n). Note that
n=0 is possible; this would be a path of length 0 consisting of just a single vertex
and no edges.
If no vertex appears twice in the path, except that possibly v<sub>0</sub> =
v<sub>n</sub>, the path is called <b>simple</b>.
If the first and last vertices are the same, the path is a <b>cycle</b>.
</p>
<p>
Some graphs have no cycles. For example, linked lists and trees are both examples
of graphs in which there are no cycles.  They are <b>directed acyclic graphs</b>,
abbreviated as DAGs. In trees and linked lists, each vertex has at most one
predecessor. In general, vertices of DAGs can have more than one predecessor.
</p>

<h2>Topological sorting</h2>
<p>
One use of directed graphs is to represent an ordering constraint on vertices.
For example, vertices might represent events, and an edge (u,v) might represent
the constraint that u must happen before v.</p>

<p>
A <b>topological sort</b> of the vertices is a <em>total</em> ordering of the vertices
that is consistent with all edges. That is, if (u,v) is an edge, then u must appear before
v in the total ordering. A graph can be topologically sorted if and only if
it has no cycles.
</p>
<p>
Topological sorts are useful for deciding in what order to do things. For
example, consider the following DAG expressing what we might call the
“men's informal dressing problem”:
</p>
<div class=figure>
<img src="dressing_dag.png">
</div>
<p>
A valid plan for getting dressed is a topological sort of this graph. In
fact, any topological sort is in principle a workable way to get dressed.  For
example, the ordering (pants, shirt, belt, socks, tie, jacket, shoes) is
consistent with the ordering on all the graph edges. Less conventional
strategies are also workable, such as (socks, pants, shoes, shirt, belt, tie,
jacket).
</p>
<p>
Does every DAG have a topological sort? Yes. To see this, observe that every
finite DAG must have a vertex with in-degree zero. To find such a vertex, we
start from an arbitrary vertex in the graph and walk backward along edges until
we reach a vertex with zero in-degree. We know that the walk must generate a
simple path because there are no cycles in the graph. Therefore, the walk
must terminate because we run out of vertices that haven't already been seen
along the walk.
</p>
<p>
This gives us an (inefficient) way to topologically sort a DAG:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with an empty ordering.
<li>Find a 0 in-degree node and put it at the end of the ordering built thus far
(the first node we do this with will be the first node in the ordering).
<li>Remove the node found from the graph.
<li>Repeat from step 2 until the graph is empty.
</ol>
<p>
Since finding the 0 in-degree node takes O(V) time, this algorithm takes
O(V<sup>2</sup>) time. We can do better, as we'll see shortly.
</p>
<h2>Other graph problems</h2>
<p>
Many problems of interest can be expressed in terms of graphs. Here are a few
examples of important graph problems, some of which can be solved efficiently
and some of which are intractable!
</p>
<h3>Reachability</h3>
<p>
One vertex is <em>reachable</em> from another if there is a path from one to the other.
Determining which vertices are reachable from a given vertex is useful and
can be done in linear time.
</p>
<h3>Shortest paths</h3>
<p>
Finding paths with the smallest number of edges is useful and can be solved
efficiently. Shortest-path problems are a generalization: finding a paths of
minimum total weight, where we think of the weight of an edge as a distance.
<p>
For example, if a road map is represented as a graph with vertices representing
intersections and edges representing road segments, the shortest-path problem
can be used to find short routes. There are several variants of the problem,
depending on whether one is interested in the distance from a given root vertex
or in the distances between all pairs of vertices. If negative-weight
edges exist, these problems become harder and different algorithms are needed.
</p>

<h3>Hamiltonian paths and the traveling salesman problem</h3>
<p>
The problem of finding the <em>longest</em> simple path between two nodes in a graph
is, in general, intractable. It is related to some other important problems.
A <b>Hamiltonian path</b> is one that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once.
A <b>Hamiltonian cycle</b> is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.
The ability to determine whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian
cycle would be useful, but in general the best known algorithms for this problem
require exponential time.
</p>
<p>
A weighted version of this problem is the <b>traveling salesman problem</b>
(TSP), which tries to find the Hamiltonian cycle with the minimum total weight.
The name comes from imagining a salesman who wants to visit every one of a set
of cities while traveling the least possible total distance. This problem is at
least as hard as finding Hamiltonian cycles and is not known to be solvable in
any less than exponential time. However, finding a solution that
is within a constant factor (e.g., 1.5) of optimal can be done in polynomial
time under some reasonable assumptions. In practice, there exist good heuristics
that allow close-to-optimal solutions to TSP even for large problem instances.
</p>

<h3>Graph coloring</h3>
<p>
Imagine that we want to schedule exams in \(k\) time slots such that no student
has two exams at the same time. We can represent this problem using an
undirected graph in which the exams are vertices, with the exams \(v_1\) and
\(v_2\) connected by an edge if there exists at least one student who
needs to take both exams. We can schedule the exams in the \(k\) slots if there
is a <b>k-coloring</b> of the graph: a way to assign a color to
each vertex with one of \(k\) colors such that no two
adjacent vertices are assigned the same color. The <b>chromatic number</b> of a graph
is the smallest number of colors needed to color it.
</p>
<p>
There is no known efficient algorithm for \(k\)-coloring in general. There are some
special classes of graphs for which coloring is efficient, and in practice,
graph colorings close to optimal can be found, but in general, the best known
algorithms to solve the problem optimally take exponential time.
</p>

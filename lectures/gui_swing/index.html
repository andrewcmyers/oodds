<h1>Graphical User Interfaces: Display and Layout</h1>
<p>
One of the driving forces behind the development of object-oriented programming
was the need to create <strong>graphical user interfaces</strong> (GUIs). It is not surprising,
then, that the OO programming model really shines when building GUIs.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the standard WIMP model of graphical user interfaces (Windows, Icons,
Menus, Pointer) was developed at Xerox PARC during the 1970's in and along with
one of the first object-oriented programming languages, Smalltalk. GUIs
influenced the language design and vice versa. The WIMP model first saw
widespread deployment by Apple with the first Macintosh computer and was
soon adopted by Microsoft Windows as well.
</p>
<p>
In this approach to graphical user interface design, the user interface is
represented internally as a tree structure, in which the various user interface
components (sometimes called <b>widgets</b> or <b>views</b>) are nodes in the tree, and the parentâ€“child
relationship corresponds to containment. In fact, the HTML markup language
follows this same approach to defining a user interface.
</p>
<p>
We will be using Swing, the standard object-oriented GUI library for Java. In such a library,
there are <em>two</em> interacting hierarchies: first, the containment hierarchy
corresponding to the tree of UI components, and second, the class hierarchy
of the components themselves. Unlike in HTML, the class hierarchy is extensible,
allowing developers to use inheritance to design new components or to customize
the behavior of existing components.
</p>
<h2>Component Tree</h2>
<p>
Swing manages the user interface as a tree of user interface components. At the
root of the tree is an object of the class <code>JFrame</code>, representing a
top-level window.
</p>
<h2>Component class hierarchy</h2>
<p>
Swing provides a rich class hierarchy of node types.
Some of them provide rendering capability, others are useful for layout, and
some are useful user interface devices such as buttons or text editors.
</p>
<p>
Swing extends an earlier toolkit, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), so all Swing components are
also AWT components. And some Swing components still use AWT components, for example to specify colors.
The root of the AWT class hierarchy is the class <code>Component</code>, with a subclass <code>Container</code>
that represents components that can have children. All Swing component classes are subclasses of <code>JComponent</code>,
which is a subclass of <code>Container</code>.

<h2>Building a GUI</h2>
<p>
A tree of components must be constructed. One way to do this is to 
write code to build the tree one node at a time.

<p>
To add a child using code:
</p>
<pre>
JComponent parent = ...;
JComponent child = ...;
p.add(child);
</pre>
<p>
The method <code>getComponents()</code> returns an array of the child components
of a given component.
</p>
<h2>GUI Designers</h2>
<p>
Support for GUI design is built into various IDEs, such as NetBeans or IntelliJ
IDEA. For example, IntelliJ has a GUI Designer for this purposes.  These design
applications give you a user interface to design GUIs and save them into an
external file in XML format that can be read in later by an application to set
up its component tree and to connect it to application code.
</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>
Generally, the children of a given component are laid out on the screen within
the bounds of their parent.  How layout occurs is determined in Swing by a
LayoutManager attached to the parent. There are several different
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html">layout managers</a>,
including the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>BorderLayout: children are laid into 5 locations: a center position with four positions on each side
                        of the center.
    <li>BoxLayout: children are laid out either horizontally or vertically.
    <li>FlowLayout: children are laid out like text on a page: in a horizontal row but adding a new row each time a row
                    does not have enough room.
    <li>GridLayout: children are arranged within a simple grid of cells
    <li>GridBagLayout: children are arranged relative to a grid of cells, but children can span multiple cells.
    <li>SpringLayout: children are laid out while satisfying a set of placement constraints
</ul>
<p>
    Often more handy is to use a component that comes with a standard layout
    manager.  For example, the class <code>Box</code> lays out its children in a
    horizontal row or vertical column. And <code>JTabbedPane</code> has a set of
    tabs that control which children are displayed.
</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>There are several ways to control the appearance of the scene. Some components have handles that
allow them to be minimized, maximized, or resized. There are also various controls such as
sliders or knobs to control shape, size, color, or other aspect of the appearance. Components can also be
added, removed, moved, or transformed.
</p>

<h2>Event-driven programs</h2>

<p>
Swing applications are <strong>event-driven</strong>. This is a different
programming paradigm from the usual imperative style. Its motto is: "Don't call us, we'll call you."
When some hardware event takes place, such as a mouse click or key press, an
event object is generated. An event object is simply a regular Java object, but
it contains information about the source and type of the event: button click,
mouse movement, keystroke, etc. The event handler of any listener that has registered to
receive the event is called, and the event object is passed to the handler.
In that way an application can receive and respond to events such as
mouse clicks and button pushes.</p>

<h2>Threads</h2>
<p>
Unlike simple Java programs, a Swing application typically has multiple
concurrent threads: a <strong>main thread</strong>, an <strong>event dispatch
thread</strong>, and optionally more threads that do computation n the
background. The job of the event dispatch thread is to loop continuously,
listening for the occurrence of hardware-generated events such as mouse clicks.
For each such occurrence, it constructs an event object describing the event
and the GUI component in which it occurred, then calls the event handler of
each registered listener with that event object.
</p>
<p>
Event handlers should not contain long-running computations, because they will
tie up the event dispatch thread, preventing events from being handled. While
the event dispatch thread is carrying out a long-running computation, the user
interface will freeze and not respond to events.  Fortunately, there is a
mechanism for scheduling an update of the GUI on the event dispatch thread
later using the method <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable r)</code>. The
<code>run()</code> method of the <code>Runnable</code> object <code>r</code> is
called at the earliest available opportunity by the event dispatch thread. It
is convenient to construct a <code>Runnable</code> object using lambda
expression (anonymous function) syntax.
</p>
<p>
Programming with threads is challenging because they share access to the same
objects. If two threads access the same object, it is challenging to prevent
them from <strong>interfering</strong>.  If one thread is in the middle of
modifying an object while another thread accesses the object, it is easy for
the observing thread to see the object in a state in which its class invariant
does not hold. A good programming pattern for preventing interference is to
have most objects <strong>owned</strong> by a single thread. Accesses (either
reading or writing) to an object by a thread that does not own the object are
unsafe and are not permitted by the pattern.
</p>
<p>
The Swing component tree follows this pattern. The component tree is owned by the
Swing event dispatch thread.  If you create a background thread to do more
time-consuming computations, it may be tempting to have the background thread
access the nodes in the scene graph.  Such accesses are not allowed. Swing provides
other mechanisms for background threads to communicate with the application thread,
notably the method <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater()</code>.

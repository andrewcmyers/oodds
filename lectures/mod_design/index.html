<h1>Modular Design and Implementation</h1>

<h2>Good code is an iceberg</h2>
<p>
Good modular design has the property that clients don't need to see much of the
code they are using. They can rely on the specification. Good code is like an
iceberg, with most of the code hidden below the water, where only implementers
need to look. In an OO language, there are actually two kinds of implementers,
with two different views of the code: the implementers of the class, and the
implementers of subclasses, who we will call specializers. Class implementers
see the whole of the iceberg (all of the code), whereas specializers see only
the public and protected parts.

<h2>Documenting implementations: The implementer's view</h2>
<div class="figure">
</div>
<p>
Our goal for documenting the implementation of a module is to support
implementation and maintenance of the module. To help future implementers, we
should also describe methods internal to the implementation, and even abstract
them.  Therefore, private method specifications are equipped with the same specification clauses
as public methods.
</p><p>
We also want to write specifications for instance variables where it is not obvious.
Two kinds of information are essential:
<ol>
<li>The meaning of the instance variable in terms of the client's abstract view.
<li>Aspects of the class invariant that the instance variable must satisfy.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Examples of instance variable specifications, including class invariants:
</p><p>
<pre>
class LinkedList<T> {
 /** First node. May be null when list is empty. */
 Node<T> first;
 /** The number of nodes in the list. size ≥ 0. */
 int size;
 /** Last node. last.next = null. May be null when list is empty. */ 
 Node<T> last;
 ...
</pre>

<p>
When we write methods like <code>LinkedList.add</code>, these invariants may be temporarily
broken:
</p>

<pre>
 /** Append x to the end of the list. */
 void add(T x) {
  // Algorithm: Create a new node. Make it the new head of the list
  // if the list is empty. Otherwise attach it to "last".
  if (first == null) {
   first = last = new Node(x, null); // size invariant broken here
  } else {
   last = last.next = new Node(x, null); // size invariant broken
  }
  size++; // invariant restored here
 }
</pre>
<h3>Default conditions</h3>
<p>
Just as with preconditions and postconditions, it is useful to have some
default expectations for class invariants, in order to keep the documentation
clear and concise. In particular, most class fields are typically required to
be non-null in order to satisfy the class invariant, so stating this condition
explicitly for each field is tiresome and clutters the code. It is better to
follow the convention that—unless explicitly documented otherwise—the class
invariant requires all instance variables to be non-null.
The above instance variables <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> are
an example of specifying the possibility of null.
</p>

<h2>Documenting implementations: the specializer's view</h2>

<p>
The specializer uses the code as a superclass with the goal of
producing a subclass that reuses, exploits, extends, or specializes superclass functionality.
The specializer may override the behavior of superclass methods that have
public or protected visibility, but may call those methods using <code>super</code>.
</p>
<p>
When we write a specification for a method that can be overridden, there are really two separate goals:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Specification for client use</b>. Defines the contract with the client that
this class and all subclasses must enforce. The client specification
is all that the client can count on, because the dynamic type of 
the object being used may not be the same as its static type.
</li>
<li><b>Overridable behavior.</b> Defines the
behavior of this particular method implementation. This behavior must be
compliant with the client specification, but it may guarantee more than the
client specification does.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, consider an implementation of an extensible chess game.
We might define a class <code>Piece</code> that gives an interface for
manipulating pieces, with subclasses such as <code>King</code> that specialize
it:
</p>

<pre>
/** A chess piece */
abstract class Piece {
   /** Spec: Iterates over all the legal moves for this piece.
    * Overridable: uses legalDestinations() to construct the legal moves.
    */
   public Iterable&lt;Move&gt; legalMoves() { ... }

   /**
    * Iterates over all destinations this piece can move to in an ordinary
    * move, including captures.
    */
   abstract protected Iterable&lt;Location&gt; legalDestinations();
}
</pre>
<p>
Given this specification for <code>Piece</code>, we can implement a piece such as
a king with extra castling moves that are not computed from the legal
destinations as with other pieces:
</p>

<pre>
class King extends Piece {
   public Iterable&lt;Move&gt; legalMoves() {
      Collection&lt;Move&gt; moves = ...;
      for (Move m : super.legalMoves()) { // rely on superclass overridable behavior
         moves.add(m);
      }
      moves.add(new CastleMove(...));
      return moves;
   }

   /** Overridable behavior: iterate over the squares adjacent
    * to the current location. */
   public Iterable&lt;Location&gt; legalDestinations() { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code>King.legalMoves</code> obeys the specification of
<code>Piece.legalMoves</code>, but overrides its behavior. Because the
implementer of <code>Piece</code> defined overridable behavior of the method, the
implementer of <code>King</code> can rely on this behavior in implementing their
own method without needing to read the details of the implementation
of <code>Piece.legalMoves</code>.
</p>

<p>
Writing classes that can be inherited and reused effectively requires
keeping these two different kinds of specification separate.
</p>

<h2>Behavioral subtyping</h2>
<p>
    We want our implementations to be usable in a modular way, even and especially
    as implementations evolve. To achieve modularity, everyone—both clients
    and specializers—should be able to rely on the contracts expressed by
    the specifications.
</p>
<p>
    One implication of obeying contracts is that when subclasses override behavior,
    the new behavior they provide should still be compatible with the existing
    specifications. In other words, it should be possible to substitute an object
    of a subclass for an object of a type that it is subtype of, not only without
    violating type safety, but also without violating the specifications of the supertype.
    In other words, inheritance needs to be used in a way that preserves
    behavioral subtyping.
</p>
<p>
    Behavioral subtyping should hold for all forms of subtyping: both classes implementing
    interfaces, and interfaces extending other interfaces. For example, recall the
    <code>Board</code> interface, which has an observer <code>tile()</code>:
<pre>
/** A state of the 2048 game, which contains a 4x4 grid of numeric tiles. */
interface Board {
   /**
    * Returns: the value of the tile at row r and column c, or 0 if that tile
    *   position is blank.
    * Requires: both r and c are in the range 0..3.
    */
   int tile(int r, int c);
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>
   Now, suppose we wanted to define a subtype <code>IBoard</code> with
   a specification for <code>tile()</code> that eliminates the precondition:
</p>
<pre>
   /**
    * Returns: the value of the tile at row r and column c, or 0 if that tile
    *   position is blank. If r and c are out of range, throws an OutOfRange
    *   exception.
    */
</pre>
<p>
    This specification <em class=term>refines</em>


    
</p>
<p>
    Behavioral subtyping is another reason why it is useful to distinguish
    between the specification provided by the specialization interface—which
    subclasses need not obey—and the (in general, more flexible) public
    specification that all subclasses of the interface or classes must obey.
    Subclasses can rely on the stronger spec provided by specialization interface,
    but most clients can only rely on the weaker public specification. The
    specialization interface of a class can only be used safely by code that
    “knows” the exact class it is using. But this knowledge implies tighter
    coupling than is usually desirable.
</p>

<h2>Module Dependency Diagrams</h2>
<p>
We have discussed how to pick operations for modules and how to specify those
operations. Moving to a higher level, it will be helpful to have methods
for planning how we are going to partition a programming effort into modules
or even into larger units like groups of modules.
</p>
<p>
The Module Dependency Diagram (MDD) is one tool that helps with planning and
communicating design at the larger scale. The idea is that the modular design
has a structure that comes out when we look at how modules depend on each
other. In an OO language, modules are classes and, to some extent, packages.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways that classes depend on each other: first, by referring to
each other, which we consider to be a "depends on" relationship, and second, by
inheritance, which is a specialized dependency, a "subclass of" relationship.
We can illustrate these two kinds of relationships with arrows:
</p>
<div class=figure>
  <img src="dep-arrows.png">
</div>
<!--
<p>
For example, consider Assignment 2. The MDD of one reasonable implementation
of this assignment is something like the following:
<div class=figure>
  <img src="a2-mdd.png">
</div>
<p class=cont>
Notice that the subclass hierarchies appear as parts of the MDD, albeit
upside-down from the usual way that we draw them, so that superclasses and
interfaces appear at the bottom of the diagram rather than the top.
</p>
-->
<p>
Drawing the MDD can help us diagnose the quality of a design and plan its
implementation.  We can tell which modules are important to the overall design,
because they have a lot of incoming arrows or can be reached from many modules
by following arrows through the MDD. We can also tell which modules are more
likely to break, because they have many outgoing arrows or can reach many other
modules by following arrows.
</p>
<p>
A good design tends to lead to a clean-looking MDD, because the dependencies of
different modules are easy to understand. A good design in which modules are
loosely coupled tends to look like a tree or an acyclic graph (a graph without cycles). Cycles in
the graph are a danger sign. For example, two modules that
depend on each other are intimately tied to one another, because changes
to either one will tend to propagate to the other, and perhaps back! A messy
MDD that looks like spaghetti probably means we should
rethink how we have divided up the tasks among modules. Often the problem is that modules
are mixing concerns, and code that has ended up in some module ought to be moved
to a different module. The dependency arrows in the MDD can show us the direction in which
code ought to move.
</p>
<h2>Implementation strategies</h2>
<p>
The MDD also helps us plan how to implement code. There
are two basic ways to go about implementing: <em class=term>top-down</em> and <em class=term>bottom-up</em>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Top-down</b>: Here we start at the top of the MDD (i.e., the main program)
and work our way down, implementing clients before the modules on which they
depend. Top-down development helps us get high-level design decisions right
early on and to understand user needs. The program is always in a demoable and
testable state as long as we write <em class=term>stub</em> or <em class=term>mock</em> implementations of the missing
pieces of the code. With top-down development, we can do <em class=term>system testing</em>
in which the whole system is being tested at once, and modulo any functionality
not yet implemented in stubs, we can test as we develop.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id="top-down-stub" style="width: 230px; height: 140px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("top-down-stub")) {
    function module_box() {
        return rectangle().setCornerRadius(12).setW(60).setH(40).setLineWidth(1.5)
    }
    setLineWidth(1.5)
    function mb() { return module_box() }
    const a = mb(), b = mb(), c = mb(), m = margin(), bc = group(b,c)
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    align("abut", "TB", b, hspace(50), c)
    align("none", "top", m, a.toTop(10))
    align("none", "bottom", m, b, c)
    arrow(a, b)
    arrow(a, c)
    let dir_arrow = vertLine(point(), point(), "gray", 5).setEndArrow("arrow").setArrowSize(20)
    saveStyle()
    setFillStyle("#fea")
    setFontSize(10)
    let stub = rectangle().setW(40).setH(20).addText("stub").setCornerRadius(8)
    restoreStyle()
    align("none", "TB", m, dir_arrow)
    align("abut", "none", dir_arrow, hspace(30), b)
    align("right", "none", c, m)
    align("center", "none", a, bc)
    align("center", "center", stub, c.cl().toLeft(5))
    arrow(a, average(a, c), stub.uc()).setLineDash([5, 5])
}
</script>
<span class=caption>top-down development</span>
</div>

<p>
<b>Bottom-up</b>: As the name suggests, we implement modules before the clients
that depend on them. Bottom-up development has the advantage that, assuming we
are testing as we go, we are also building upon solid, fully implemented
foundations. As we implement each module, we can immediately test it with
<em class=term>unit tests</em> designed for that module. Since the top levels of the
program are not present, we test instead using a <em class=term>test harness</em> for each
module. The test harness contains that module's unit tests. Bottom-up development is
particularly effective when it is not clear whether key parts of the
system can be implemented with acceptable performance.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id="bottom-up-harness" style="width: 230px; height: 140px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("bottom-up-harness")) {
    function module_box() {
        return rectangle().setCornerRadius(12).setW(60).setH(40).setLineWidth(1.5)
    }
    setLineWidth(1.5)
    function mb() { return module_box() }
    const a = mb(), b = mb(), c = mb(), m = margin(), bc = group(b,c)
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    align("abut", "TB", b, hspace(50), c)
    align("none", "top", m, a.toTop(10))
    align("none", "bottom", m, b, c)
    arrow(a, b)
    arrow(a, c)
    let dir_arrow = vertLine(point(), point(), "gray", 5).setStartArrow("arrow").setArrowSize(20)
    saveStyle()
    setFillStyle("#fea")
    setFontSize(10)
    let harness = rectangle().setW(60).setH(20).addText("harness").setCornerRadius(8)
    restoreStyle()
    align("none", "TB", m, dir_arrow)
    align("abut", "none", dir_arrow, hspace(30), b)
    align("right", "none", harness, m)
    align("center", "none", a, bc)
    align("center", "center", harness, c.uc().toTop(35).toRight(10))
    arrow(harness, c).setLineDash([5, 5])
}
</script>
<span class=caption>bottom-up development</span>
</div>

<p>
Which implementation strategy is better? It depends on what we are trying to
build. Typically, we want to reduce the risk that we will do extra work, by
discarding code or by setting up a structure in which the desired functionality
is difficult to implement. Top-down development is helpful for reducing the
risk that the customer needs are not going to be met, or that the high-level
structure of the program is not going to work out. Bottom-up development
reduces the risk that core technologies will be infeasible, potentially
requiring a redesign of all of the modules depending on them.
</p>
<p>
In practice, we often want to use both styles of design at once, depending on
our assessment of where the main risks lie. Before implementing a program,
especially when working on a team, it is a good idea to decide on the MDD and
come up with an implementation strategy that addresses the risks effectively
through a mixture of top-down and bottom-up development. The implementation
strategy should include any stubs or test harnesses needed to test the code as
it is being developed. After sketching the MDD, the team should design the
interfaces that define the boundaries between different modules. Good interface
design and clear specs are especially important at the boundaries where
different programmers will interact.
</p>

<h2>How to add bugs</h2>
<p>
Why do programmers write code with so many bugs? One important reason is the
excessive use of copying and pasting code. Copying and pasting buggy code
automatically duplicates all the bugs. Furthermore, programmers
frequently fail to completely adapt the copied code to the new setting where it
is being pasted, creating entire fresh new bugs.
In fact, one effective way to find bugs in programs is
to automatically search for code that appears to be copied and pasted,
but where the pasted version has not been consistently adapted to its new
context.
</p>
<p>
Copying and pasting code is a lazy shortcut that usually creates
more work in the long run. When you feel the need to copy code, try instead to
introduce an abstraction (a class, a method) that captures the functionality
that you are copying. You might have to think a little harder, but your code
will typically be shorter and better, and you'll save time in the end.
</p>

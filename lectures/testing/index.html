<h1>Lecture 13: More testing and documenting code</h1>

<h2>More testing techniques</h2>
<p>
Recall that the goal of testing is to see how the program behaves in some
situations and on some inputs and from that derive confidence that it works in
all situations and all inputs.  This is challenging because the number of possible ways
to run the program is typically infinite. On the other hand, most possible tests are redundant.
The idea is to achieve <b>coverage</b> of the space of possible program executions by
making sure that all interesting distinct regions of the space of executions are tested.
</p>
<p>As we discussed last time, one way to achieve coverage is to carefully
design test cases, aiming for good coverage.  To identify the interesting
regions of the input space, we can look at the program or module specification.
A good spec will identify interesting boundaries and seams in the input space
that help us decide what needs to be tested.  This approach is <b>black-box
testing</b>.
</p>
A second approach is to look at the implementation code as a way of identifying
the interesting possible executions. This is <b>glass-box testing</b>. For
example, different execution paths in the implementation correspond to
different kinds of executions that should all be tested.  Code coverage and
path coverage are ways to get assurance that the whole space is covered.
</p>

<h3>Random testing</h3>

<p>A different approach to getting coverage is <b>random testing</b>. We
generate many test cases, hoping that some test case hits each interesting
region of the input space. This can be very effective, especially for unit
testing of small modules. The weakness of this approach is that there may be
corner cases that are very unlikely to be hit randomly, because they are such a
small part of the input space as a whole. In general it is challenging to
generate random test cases that cover the whole input space, perhaps also 
trying to bias random choices to try to hit more interesting regions.
</p>

<h3>Bounded exhaustive testing</h3>

<p>Testing cannot be exhaustive, in general. We cannot hope to test all
possible inputs.  But what is feasible in many cases is to test all inputs of
up to some small size. For example, if testing a tree implementation, we might
test all the tree operations on all trees of up to height 5. This approach
relies on a rule of thumb, the <b>small counterexample hypothesis</b>, which
says that there is usually a small test case that exposes any given bug.
Equivalently, we could conjecture that every interesting region in the input
space contains a small test case, so by testing all small test cases, we cover
all the interesting regions.</p>
<p>
Bounded exhaustive testing can be highly effective at catching bugs. The
weakness, like with random testing, is that it is challenging in general to
enumerate all possible legal small test cases.  In Java, this kind of code is
particularly awkward to write because of the weak support for iteration.
</p>
<p>
The small counterexample hypothesis frequently holds, but not always! For example,
the Java sorting algorithm (Timsort) is known to be incorrect but only for very large
arrays. Its incorrectness was not discovered via testing, but by trying to formally prove
it correct—and failing.
</p>

<h3>Symbolic execution</h3>
<p>
Another way to reduce the space of inputs is <b>symbolic execution</b>, in which
program execution is simulated in an environment in which some variables or fields are
represented symbolically rather than as actual values in the programming languages.
The execution environment tracks constraints on (i.e., knowledge about) the values of
these variables. At points where, say, an assertion happens or a null pointer might
occur, these constraints can be inspected to see whether they guarantee that no
error results.
</p>
<p>
Running a program with symbolic execution is much more expensive than running
it normally, and it requires special software support that is not yet
mainstream. However, each symbolic execution of a program potentially
represents a large number of regular executions, so it can be much more
efficient at finding bugs. Symbolic execution can also be used along with
random testing or bounded exhaustive testing to make them more effective.
</p>
<h2>Using assertions</h2>
<p>Assertions (that is, <tt>assert</tt>) are extremely useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>They put useful tests into the code itself where you don't have to remember to run them.</li>
<li>They also add useful documentation about things the implementer expected to be true, so they
don't clutter the code in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what to use <code>assert</code> on? One obvious target is preconditions and postconditions.
On entry to a method, use an <code>assert</code> to check that the requires clause holds. On
every exit from a method, check that the returns clause is satisfied. If a method fails to live
up to its spec, you'll know immediately and be able to debug the right code.
</p>
<pre>
/* Requires/Checks: X
 * Returns: Y
 */
m() {
    assert X;
    ...// method impl here
    assert Y;
    return;
}
</pre>

<p>You might be worried that checking preconditions is very expensive. Fortunately, assertion checking can be turned on and off by providing options to the JVM:
<ul>
<li><tt>-ea</tt> : enable assertions everywhere except in system libraries
<li><tt>-esa</tt> : enable assertions in system libraries
<li><tt>-ea:&lt;classname&gt;</tt> : enable assertions in class <tt>&lt;classname&gt;</tt>
<li><tt>-ea:&lt;packagename&gt;</tt> : enable assertions in all classes in this package and subpackages.
</ul>

<p>Corresponding <tt>-da</tt> options can be used to turn off assertion checking selectively.</p>

<h2>Representation invariants</h2>

<p>Checking preconditions and postconditions is very useful, but the real
secret to building working code is checking <b>data structure invariants</b>,
also known as <b>representation (rep) invariants</b>. For example, when
building a binary search tree implementation, we want every node in the tree to
satisfy the binary search tree invariant that all elements in the left subtree
are less and all elements in the right subtree are greater.
<p>
An invariant is something that is &ldquo;always&rdquo; true. In this case
&ldquo;always&rdquo; means at the beginning and end of methods. In the middle of
a method, the rep invariant might be temporarily violated.
</p>
<p>
Rep invariants alert maintainers about the need to keep object state in
sync. Updating one field may force updates to others to maintain the
invariant.
</p>
<p>
Interesting rep invariants are almost always worth checking. To do this we implement
a method that checks the rep invariant:
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns whether this satisfies the rep invariant. */
boolean RI() {
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>We can then use the <code>RI()</code> to check the rep invariant at the beginnings and ends
of methods:</p>

<pre>
/* Requires/Checks: X
 * Returns: Y
 */
m() {
    assert X &amp;&amp; RI();
    ...// method impl here
    assert Y &amp;&amp; RI();
    return;
}
</pre>

<p>
There are two benefits here:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If the rep invariant is broken by some method, we find out immediately and we know which method to fix.
Data structure corruption bugs are otherwise often very difficult to fix.
<li>The <code>RI()</code> also is a kind of very precise documentation of the rep invariant, which is
useful for maintenance and extension of the code.
</ol>

<h3>Example: checking the BST invariant</h3>

<pre>
/** Check the BST invariant. */
boolean RI() {
    return root == null || elemsBetween(root, null, null);
}

/** Whether n satisfies the BST invariant and
 *  whether all elems under n are less than upper (if upper != null) and
 *  whether all elems under n are greater than lower (if lower != null).
 */
boolean elemsBetween(Node<T> n, T lower, T upper) {
    if (lower != null &amp;&amp; n.data.compareTo(lower) &lt;= 0)
	return false;
    if (upper != null &amp;&amp; n.data.compareTo(upper) &gt;= 0)
	return false;
    return (left == null || elemsBetween(left, lower, n.data)) &amp;&amp;
           (right == null || elemsBetween(right, n.data, upper));
}
</pre>

<p>Now we stick calls to <code>RI()</code> into all tree methods, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
void add(T elem) {
    assert RI();
    // do usual tree insertion here
    assert RI();
    return;
}
</pre>


<h2>Documenting implementations: The implementer's view</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="lec13/codeberg.png"/>
</div>
<p>
Our goal for documenting the implementation is to support implementation and
maintenance by describing implementation methods and even abstracting them.
Therefore, private methods have the same clauses as public ones.
</p><p>
We also want to write specifications for fields where it is not obvious.
Two kinds of information are essential:
<ol>
<li>describing what values of the fields mean in terms of the client's abstract view.
<li>stating the rep invariant that these fields must satisfy.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Example of field specifications including rep invariants:
</p><p>
<pre>
class LinkedList<T> {
  /** First node. May be null when list is empty. */
  Node<T> first;
  /** The number of nodes in the list. size ≥ 0. */
  int size;
  /** Last node. last.next = null. May be null when list is empty. */ 
  Node<T> last;
  ...
</pre>

<p>
When we write methods like <code>LinkedList.add</code>, these invariants may be temporarily
broken:
</p>

<pre>
  /** Append x to the end of the list. */
  void add(T x) {
    // Algorithm: Create a new node. Make it the new head of the list
    // if the list is empty. Otherwise attach it to "last".
    if (first == null) {
      first = last = new Node(x, null); // size invariant broken here
    } else {
      last = last.next = new Node(x, null); // size invariant broken
    }
    size++; // invariant restored here
  }
</pre>

<h2>Documenting implementations: the specializer's view</h2>

<p>
The specializer uses the code as a superclass, with the goal of
producing a subclass that reuses superclass functionality. The
specializer may override the behavior of existing methods that have
public or protected visibility. When we write a specification for 
a method that can be overridden, there are really two separate goals:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Client specification. Define the contract with the client that
this class and all subclasses must enforce. The client specification
is all that the client can count on, because the dynamic type of 
the object being used may not be the same the static type.
</li>
<li> Overridable behavior. Define the behavior of this particular
method implementation. This behavior must be compliant with the client
specification, but it may guarantee more than the client specification
does.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, consider an implementation of an extensible chess game.
We might define a class "Piece" that gives an interface for
manipulating pieces, with subclasses such as "King" that specialize
it:
</p>

<pre>
/** A chess piece */
class Piece {
    /** Spec: Iterates over all the legal moves for this piece.
     *  Overridable behavior: uses legal_destinations() to construct
     *  the legal moves.
     */
    public Iterator<Move> legal_moves();

    /** Iterates over all destinations this piece can move to in an
     * ordinary move, including captures. */
    protected Iterator<Location> legal_destinations();
}
</pre>
<p>
Given this specification for "Piece", we can implement a piece such as
a king with extra castling moves that are not computed from the legal
destinations as with other pieces:
</p>

<pre>
class King extends Piece {
    public Iterator<Move> legal_moves() {
        Collection moves = ...;
	for (m:super.legal_moves()) { // rely on superclass overridable behavior
	    moves.add(m);
	}
	m.add(new CastleMove(...));
	return moves.iterator();
    }

    /** Overridable behavior: iterate over the squares adjacent
     *  to the current location. */
    public Iterator<Location> legal_destination() {
      ...
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that "King.legal_moves" obeys the specification of
"Piece.legal_moves", but overrides its behavior. Because the
implementer of "Piece" defined overridable behavior of the method, the
implementer of "King" can rely on this behavior in implementing their
own method, without needing to read the details of the implementation
of "Piece.legal_moves".
</p>

<p>
Writing classes that can be inherited and reused effectively requires
keeping these two different kinds of specification separate.

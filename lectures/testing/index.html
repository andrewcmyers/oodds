<h1 id="Testing">Testing</h1>

<h2>Testing in software development</h2>
<p>
It is tempting to defer testing, like documentation, to fairly late in the
software development process. For example, in the <b>waterfall model</b>
of development, testing is used for the validation step
occurring late in the process:

<div class=figure>

</div>

<p>
While the steps of the waterfall model are all real tasks that must be done, in
practice each phase cannot be complete before the next one begins. Each phase can
influence the ones that come before it in the model. The waterfall model was
actually originally proposed as a straw man that developers should not follow, but
it has had serious proponents. At this point it is generally understood as an example
of how <em>not</em> to do development.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the waterfall model is that it appears
to defer all validation to the end. However, code that hasn't been tested should be
assumed to be broken; waiting until development is finished to start testing is
a recipe for disaster. Note that by validation, we mean any process that
increases our confidence in the correctness of the system; it can include both
testing and formal verification. Testing is the validation process used most
in practice. In our discussion of loop invariants, we've also gotten a taste
of formal verification, where the goal is a rigorous mathematical argument that
code works correctly on all inputs.
</p>

<h3>When to test?</h3>
<p>
The time to test is before, during, and after implementation. We can even start
working on testing before we have started implementing code. This helps because
the process of designing tests for the system already identifies design flaws. 
Early testing not only tests the code, it tests the specifications and even the
tests themselves. Failed tests may fail because the tests themselves are
wrong! When you're debugging your code, it's very useful to be able to rely on
the tests being right.
</p>
<p>
The key to success is <b>continuous testing</b> throughout the development
process. As each feature is added or module is implemented, test cases should
be developed to validate the implementation work done. With continuous testing,
new bugs that are discovered will tend to be found in recently written code,
helping you localize the error. Continuous testing works particularly well when
code contains assertions to check preconditions, postconditions, and
invariants.
</p>

<h3>Regression testing</h3>
<p>
Code modifications often introduce new bugs, even breaking working
functionality.  And it's not just modifications that add new functionality.  In
fact, studies of software development have shown that roughly 1/3 of all bug
fixes introduce new bugs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Regression testing</b> helps address this problem. A <b>test
suite</b> containing tests that cover the functionality of the program is
developed; these tests can then be run to make sure that working features of
the code have not "regressed". For regression testing to be effective, it
should be as automatic and easy to invoke as possible—a "push-button" process.
Many software organizations even
include regression testing as a standard part of the software build process,
preventing developers from pushing changes to the code repository if regression
tests fails. The time invested in automating regression tests is time well spent
for even moderate-sized projects.
</p>
<p>
The test suites associated with a software project are tremendously valuable.
Like code documentation, they are part of the code of the project and should be
curated and maintained with equal care. It is tempting to take shortcuts with
testing code because it isn't shipped to the customer; this would be a mistake.
</p>


<h2>Strategies for test design</h2>
<p>
For most programs, the number of possible inputs is staggeringly huge. For
example, a program that accepts two ints as its inputs already has \(2^{64}\)
possible inputs.  We won't be able to test the program on all these inputs in a
reasonable amount of time.  Exhaustive testing is infeasible.  Therefore,
testing is by nature a finite approximation of exhaustive testing. How can we
perform a relatively small, finite number of tests, and nevertheless gain
confidence that the program works in all situations?  This is the problem of
achieving <b>coverage</b>. There are several good strategies for achieving meaningful
coverage.
</p>
<h3>Black-box testing</h3>
<p>
In <b>black-box testing</b>, we design test cases by looking at the spec rather than
the code. We design test cases that not only include "typical cases" but also
edge and corner cases that (from the spec) we can see are atypical in one way
or another. Because we are designing test cases without looking at the
implementation, we can even design black-box test cases before the
implementation is written. In fact, writing black-box test cases also helps get the
specs right, because thinking about testing helps us realize when specs are incomplete
or ambiguous. Developing tests early also leads to a better implementation because it
causes us to think more deeply about what will happen in corner cases.
</p>
<p>
Let's consider an example of developing black-box tests.
Suppose we are testing the <code>remove</code> operation of
a linked list implementation. We would want to test some "typical" cases
in which the element is in the list, but also some corner cases:
<ul>
<li>when the element is not in the list;
<li>when the list is empty;
<li>when the element is the first in the list;
<li>when the element is the last in the list;
<li>when the list contains only the element to be removed.
</ul>
<p>
Black-box testing requires the programmer to define input/output pairs,
in which the correct output corresponding to each input is defined. This
can be a time-consuming process.
</p>

<h3>Glass-box testing</h3>
<p>
In <b>glass-box testing</b> we design test cases based on the implementation code.
The goal is achieve coverage of all the ways the code can behave, under the reasonable
assumption that any untested functionality in the code could hide a bug.
</p>
<p>
At a minimum, glass-box testing requires that we test every method. But
we should go even further to obtain higher assurance:
<ul>
<li>Every line of code should be exercised.
<li>Every path through the code should be taken.
<li>Every data structure that the code can build should be built.
</ul>
<p>
In general it is infeasible to take every path through the code in a finite set
of test cases, because even a single loop defines an infinite number of paths
depending on how many times the loop repeats. Here we can fall back on the strategy
of sampling the space intelligently. We test both the "typical" case in which the
loop does a few iterations and the boundary cases of 0 or 1 iterations. This approach is
especially effective for catching "off-by-one" errors.
</p>

<h3>Randomized testing</h3>
<p>
Designing test cases that exercise all parts of the code and specification is
challenging. Often, higher assurance can be obtained by generating test cases
randomly, either by generating random inputs or, in the case that the module
has internal state, sequences of random inputs. This approach is often called
<b>fuzzing</b>. If enough test cases are
generated, the coverage may be excellent. In general, some care may be needed
in generating test cases if the corner cases are unlikely to be hit by chance.
</p>
<p>
With black-box and glass-box testing, input/output pairs must be designed. Where
do we get these when doing randomized testing? In general we are not going to be
able to fully test that the outputs of the code agree with the specification,
so we must settle for weaker properties of the code being tested, such as not
throwing unexpected assertions or failing assertions. Therefore, adding useful
assertions to code helps with testing. By capturing programmer knowledge and
intent, as discussed earlier. Test cases that cause assertions to fail reveal
discrepancies between the code and the intent of the programmer
even if the final output of the test is not checked.
</p>
<p>
One way that we can use randomized testing to test against the spec is with
a <b>reference implementation</b> of the same specification&mdash;perhaps a less
efficient, simpler implementation of the same abstraction. In this case, the
two implementations can be compared on random test cases to ensure they agree.
This approach is especially useful in large software projects that start with
a prototype implementation to establish feasibility. The prototype can be used
as a reference implementation during the development of the final product. 
</p>
<p>
Another approach that can be used to find bugs in the absence of a reference implementation
or spec is to generate <em>pairs</em> of inputs that are expected to yield the same
result. The test is then to check whether they do indeed produce the same result.
Such pairs of inputs can be generated by starting from a random test case and then
doing a local behavior-preserving mutation to it to produce the other element of the pair.
</p>
<p>
Randomized testing requires a <b>test case generator</b>. Writing a test case
generator manually can be particularly challenging when the test cases must
satisfy a complex precondition that is unlikely to be satisfied by most
randomly generated inputs. One way to solve that problem is to generate random
inputs, then "fix" them into inputs that satisfy the precondition. Another is
to generate each input by perturbing a previous input randomly in a way that
preserves the precondition.
</p>
<p>
Modern <b>coverage-guided fuzzers</b> like <a
href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a>, <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/jfuzz/">jFuzz</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/rohanpadhye/JQF">JQF</a> automatically generate test
cases to increase code coverage. They generate new random test cases by
mutating existing ones, keeping track of which code paths are explored during
execution. Test cases are deemed interesting if they cause new paths to be
explored.
</p>
<p>
While automatic test case generation is not always easy, tool support is
steadily improving. JUnit Theories and Haskell QuickCheck are examples of
tools that support this style of testing.
</p>

<h3>Bounded exhaustive testing</h3>
<p>
An alternative to randomized testing is to generate exhaustive test cases that
completely cover the space tested. Full exhaustive testing is not feasible, of
course. However, for most program bugs, there is some "small" (in some sense)
test case on which the bug is exhibited. This is the <b>small counterexample
hypothesis</b>. Therefore, we design test cases so that all test cases (or
input sequences) of up to a certain maximum size are tested. For example, if we
want to test a method that operates on a tree data structure, we might generate
all possible trees of up to height 5. A buggy algorithm that manipulates trees
is unlikely to work perfectly on all trees of size 5 or less. As with randomized
testing, the challenge is to generate the test cases, but tool support continues
to improve.
</p>

<h3>Symbolic execution</h3>
<p>
Testing on particular inputs leaves open the possibility that the bug is exhibited
only on the inputs not chosen. Another idea for how to obtain coverage is to
use <b>symbolic execution</b> in which the code is run on symbolic inputs rather
than actual values. This approach requires special tool support to be able to
run programs in this alternate (and expensive) mode. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is that rather than giving each variable a concrete value, the
execution carries around a logical formula describing constraints on the
possible values that variables can take on. The initial constraints for
the code of a method would come from the precondition of the method, but
new constraints are obtained from the flow of control within the program.
For example, consider the following code. It is not immediately obvious
whether this code can crash:
</p>

<pre>
/** Requires: y ≥ 0. */
int f(int x, int y) {
  if (y > 0) {
    d = x/y;
  } else {
	assert y == 0;
	d = y + 1;
  }
  x = x/d;
}
</pre>

<p>A symbolic executor proceeds by starting with the preconditions and
propagating them through the program. Where a conditional cannot be
unambiguously evaluated, execution splits and two executions proceed
with different information. For example, in the following execution,
we don't know whether y&gt;0 or not, so both paths are followed. In
each path, we use the result of the comparison of y&gt;0 to strengthen
the information we have available:
<pre>
/** Requires: y ≥ 0. */
int f(int x, int y) {
  // x can be anything, y ≥ 0
  if (y > 0) {
	// x can be anything, y > 0
    d = x/y;
	// d can be anything, y > 0
  } else {
	// x can be anything, y == 0
	assert y == 0; // cannot fail
	d = y + 1;
	// y == 0 and d == 1
  }
  // (y == 0 and d == 1) or (d can be anything, y > 0)
  x = x/d;
}
</pre>

<p>The path of execution when y&gt;0 has no information about the
value of d, which means that when we get to the statement <code>x = x/d</code>,
we cannot show that <code>d != 0</code>. We have found a potential bug. By representing
the values of variables logically, symbolic
execution effectively runs a very large number of test cases at the same time.
</p>
<p>There are a couple weaknesses of symbolic execution. One is that, just
because it reveals a potential bug, it does not mean that there is one.
There may be paths in the program that will never be taken, and the potential
bug may only show up on one such path. Thus there can be false positives.
But a more critical weakness is that it is cumbersome and does not scale to large programs.
However, it can be very effective on smaller implementations. Tools for symbolic
execution are still not mainstream but are maturing.

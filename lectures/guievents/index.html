<h1>Graphical User Interfaces: Events and Animation</h1>

<h2>Handling events</h2>
<p>
Programs can define <strong>event handlers</strong> to handle different types of input events. Handlers must be registered to receive events with a GUI component on which the event can occur. There are several ways to specify a handler: classes, inner classes, or lambda expressions. All are basically syntactic sugar for the same thing, but convenient. Here is an example with a lambda expression:
<pre>
Button b = ...;
b.setOnAction(e -&gt; print("button clicked"));
</pre>
<p>
This is essentially the Observer pattern, but for many events, there can be
only one registered handler. Lambda expressions are really just syntactic sugar
for <b>inner classes</b>, which are anonymous classes implementing a specified
interface. In this case, the method <code>setOnAction</code> expects to
receive an object implementing the interface <code>EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;</code>,
where <code>EventHandler</code> is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="EventHandler.java">EventHandler.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
It is not necessary to use a lambda expression to implement an event handler. The
lambda expression is syntactic sugar for the following code defining an inner class:
<pre class="load">
<a href="../gui/desugared_lambda.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
It is not even necessary to use an inner class; an ordinary class can be used to
implement the desired interface, as in the following code:
<pre class="load">
<a href="../gui/desugared_top_level_class.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In fact, even inner classes are syntactic sugar for top-level classes. Because
they are just syntactic sugar, they come with some limitations. In particular,
inner classes and lambda expressions can only refer to variables defined
outside their scope if those variables are final. The reason for this
limitation is that their objects may outlive the external variables they refer
to. For that reason, the implementation of inner classes and lambdas actually
makes a copy of any such external variable. Since the variable is final, there
is no way for the programmer to tell that such a copy has been made!

<h1>Events and Animation</h1>

<h2>Encoding and reading scene graphs</h2>
<p>
Constructing scene graphs by writing code can be tedious and also increase
coupling between the way the user interface looks and the way it behaves.
Instead, JavaFX provides a convenient way to define scene graphs using
the syntax of XML (short for “Extensible Markup Language”). A file with an
<tt>.fxml</tt> extension specifies how to construct a JavaFX scene graph.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a simple user interface with an editable text area
and a button:
</p>
<center>
<img width="40%" src="fxml-screenshot.png" />
</center>
<p>
In addition to the text area and button, we will need some other pane
nodes to place them in the window. We can capture this layout separately
from code by specifying the scene graph as XML like the following:
</p>

<pre class="load">
<a href="simple.fxml">simple.fxml</a>
</pre>
<p>
In principle this XML content can be created from scratch, but we are more
likely to create and edit it using the Scene Builder tool.
</p>

<p>
Given such an FXML file,
JavaFX lets us write simple code to initialize a scene graph from it.
Further, instance variables in the code (<code>theButton</code> and
<code>theTextArea</code>) can be initialized from the correspondingly named
nodes in the FXML file, by attaching <code>@FXML</code> annotations:
</p>

<pre class="load">
<a href="fxmlMain.java">fxmlMain.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
Such instance variables are initially null, but The
<code>initialize()</code> method of the application is called after they
have been given a value from the FXML file. This method is then the
place to add further customization of behavior or appearance.
</p>

<h2>Handling events</h2>
<p>
The example program above has a button but it doesn't do anything yet
when pushed. To make that happen we need to define how the program
should handle that event.
</p>
<p>
Programs can define <strong>event handlers</strong> to handle different
types of input events. Handlers must be registered to receive
events with a GUI component on which the event can occur. There are
several ways to specify a handler: classes, inner classes, or lambda
expressions. All are basically syntactic sugar for the same thing, but
convenient. Here is an example with a lambda expression:
<pre>
Button b = ...;
b.setOnAction(e -&gt; println("button clicked"));
</pre>
<p>
This code causes the button to call the provided function whenever
the button is activated by clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
This code is essentially the Observer pattern, but for many events,
there can be only one registered handler. Lambda expressions are really
just syntactic sugar for <b>inner classes</b>, which are anonymous
classes implementing a specified interface. In this case, the method
<code>setOnAction</code> expects to receive an object implementing
the interface <code>EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;</code>, where
<code>EventHandler</code> has a single method. Interfaces with
single methods can be implemented by a lambda expression like
the one above.
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="EventHandler.java">EventHandler.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
It is not necessary to use a lambda expression to implement an event handler. The
lambda expression is syntactic sugar for the following code defining an inner class:
<pre class="load">
<a href="desugared_lambda.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
It is not even necessary to use an inner class; we could
implement the <code>EventHandler</code> interface using an
ordinary top-level class:
<pre class="load">
<a href="desugared_top_level_class.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In fact, inner classes are syntactic sugar for top-level
classes. Because lambda expressions and inner classes are just syntactic
sugar, they have some limitations. In particular, inner classes and
lambda expressions can only refer to variables defined outside their
scope if those variables are immutable. The reason for this limitation
is that their objects may outlive the external variables they refer
to. For that reason, the implementation of inner classes and lambdas
actually makes a copy of the value fo any such external variable.  Since
the variable is final, there is no way for the programmer to tell that
such a copy has been made!
</p>
<h3>Handling events with FXML</h3>
<p>
The binding between a scene graph node and the action it triggers
can be defined in an FXML file. For example, in the FXML example
above, the <code>Button</code> node can be given a method to
invoke when the button is clicked:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="button-action.fxml">button-action.fxml</a>
</pre>
<p>
Then we define a corresponding method to call with an <code>@FXML</code>
annotation so that JavaFX can connect the node and method together:
<pre class="load">
<a href="handleButtonPressed.java">handleButtonPressed.java</a>
</pre>

<h2>Event types</h2>
<p>
Graphical user interfaces respond to events and can also generate new events.
There are many kinds of events,  which in JavaFX are all subclasses of the
class <a
href="https://openjfx.io/javadoc/23/javafx.base/javafx/event/package-summary.html"><code>javafx.event.Event</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
Low-level events include keyboard keys or mouse buttons being pressed
or released, and motion occurring on a mouse or trackpad. Other events
coming from outside the application include changes to the size or
visibility of application windows.
</p>
<p>
JavaFX also automatically synthesizes some higher-level events from
lower-level ones. For example, a mouse button press and release when the mouse
is positioned over a GUI button causes the button to generate an action event.
Pressing the mouse button twice quickly causes a double-click event.
These events are automatically generated by JavaFX; applications can
define their own new events similarly.
</p>
<p>
Thus, there are three main kind of events in JavaFX, represented
by different classes that implement 
<ol>
<li>
The class <code>InputEvent</code> represents low-level input events, with
subclasses like <code>KeyEvent</code>, <code>MouseEvent</code>,
<code>TouchEvent</code>, <code>GestureEvent</code>, and
<code>DragEvent</code>.
<li> Class <code>WindowEvent</code> represents events from the window
manager.
<li> Class
<code>ActionEvent</code> represents higher-level events generated by controls
such as Button.
</ol>
<p>
Every event has an <strong>event target</strong>, which is often the current
window (<code>Stage</code>).  Each event also carries additional
information specific to the event.  For example, mouse events include the
position of the mouse, keyboard events specify the key, and so on.
</p>
<h2>Event delegation</h2>
<p>
When an event is generated by JavaFX, a complex process is used to
determine which code should handle the event. Based on the event
target, an <strong>event dispatch chain</strong> is determined.  The
event dispatch chain usually corresponds to a path through the scene
graph from the scene down to some leaf, although this behavior can be
overridden.
</p>
<p>Each node in the event dispatch chain has the opportunity
to handle the event and perform some action, such as updating the
application state or generating new events. An event handler also
has the ability to consume it by calling its <code>consume()</code>
method, preventing it from being seen by the rest of the chain.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
Scene graph nodes have state that can be queried by calling observer
methods. Generally speaking, these observer methods also have
corresponding methods that return <strong>property objects</strong>.
Property objects can be read at any time to learn the current value
of the property. Thus, for a method named <code>getX()</code> there
is typically another method <code>XProperty</code> that provides
the corresponding property. For a node <code>n</code>, the value of 
<code>n.getX()</code> is always equal to <code>n.XProperty().getValue()</code>.
Further, for properties that are not read-only, the property can
be even used to change the value in the node.
</p>
<p>
This table lists some useful observer methods and the corresponding property
methods. If the observer method returns a value of type <code>T</code>,
the property method returns a property object whose class implements the
interface <code>ObservableValue&lt;T&gt;</code>:
</p>

<table class=rowlines>
<tr>
<th>Observer method</th><th>Property method</th>
<tr>
<td><code>boolean isDisabled()</code>
<td><code>BooleanProperty disabledProperty()</code>
<tr>
<td><code>double getWidth()<br> double getHeight()</code>
<td><code>ReadOnlyDoubleProperty widthProperty()<br>
ReadOnlyDoubleProperty heightProperty()</code>
<tr>
<td><code>double getLayoutX()<br> double getLayoutY()</code>
<td><code>DoubleProperty layoutXProperty()<br>
DoubleProperty layoutYProperty()</code>
<tr>
<td><code>String getText()</code>
<td><code>StringProperty textProperty()</code>
</table>

<h3>Property listeners</h3>
<p>
Properties can be used to trigger actions by the application, by attaching
<strong>listeners</strong> to them of type
<code>ChangeListener&lt;T&gt;</code>.  When the value (of type <code>T</code>
of the property changes, a method of the listener is called:
</p>
<pre>
 void changed(ObservableValue&lt;? extends T&gt; observable,
              T oldValue, T newValue); 
</pre>
<p>
The passed argument <code>observable</code> would be the property whose
value changed from value <code>oldvalue</code> to <code>newValue</code>.
</p>
<p>In the example program above, we could extend the behavior of the text area
by adding a listener that monitors changes to the contents of the text area
and performs an action:
<pre>
@Override
public void initialize(final URL location, ResourceBundle resources) {
    theTextArea.textProperty().addListener((obs, before, after) -&gt;
        println("Text changed to " + after);
}
</pre>
<p>
Listeners can be a useful as a way to loosen coupling but they can also make
the control flow of the program hard to understand, since updates to one
property can trigger listeners that then cause immediate updates to other
properties.
</p>

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>
Properties make it easy to add animations that can make programs more
usable or attractive. An animation is created by defining a sequence of
<strong>key frames</strong> corresponding to different moments in time.
A key frame specifies the values of various properties at that point
in time. Given this specification, JavaFX creates a smooth animation
by interpolating the values of properties between key frames. For example,
the following figure shows how the position of an object on the screen might
be controlled by a sequence of key frames that specify its horizontal and
vertical position. Of course, properties other than position can also be
controlled in this way, including properties like rotational orientation
or even color.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id="keyframe_animation" style="height: 400px">
</canvas>
<span class=caption>A key-frame animation. Red is the horizontal position and green is the vertical.</span>
</div>
<p>
An animation is defined by creating a <code>Timeline</code> object
and adding key frames to it. Each key frame has a specified
duration (in milliseconds) and a set of pairs of properties and values
specified as <code>KeyValue</code> objects. A key frame may also
have an event handler to be invoked to perform some action at the end
of the key frame when the properties reach their final values.
</p>
<p>
By default, animations linearly interpolate property values, so that
properties change at a constant rate during the key frame. Smoother
interpolation can be achieved for a property by specifying other interpolators
in the <code>KeyValue</code> object for the property.

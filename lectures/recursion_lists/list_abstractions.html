We'll see how to remove nodes from a linked list in a minute.

<h2>Building abstractions using linked lists</h2>
<p>
Linked lists are useful data structures, but using them directly can lead
to programming errors. Often their utility comes from using them to implement
other abstractions.
</p>
<h3>Immutable lists</h3>
<p>
For example, we can use a linked list to efficiently implement an <b>immutable
list</b> of objects:

<pre>
// An immutable, ordered, finite sequence of objects (a<sub>0</sub>,
// a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub>), which may be empty.
interface ImmList {
    /** Returns: the first object in the list (a<sub>0</sub>).
     *  Checks: the list is not empty. */
    Object first();

    /** Returns: a list containing all elements but the first, i.e.,
     * (a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub>)
     *  Checks: the list is not empty.  */
    ImmList rest();

    /** Returns whether this is the empty list. */
    boolean empty();

    /** Returns: a list containing the same elements as this,
     *  but with the object x inserted at the beginning. That is,
     *  (x, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub>) 
     *  Checks: the list is not empty.  */
    ImmList cons(Object x)
}
</pre>
To implement this interface using a <code>null</code>-terminated list, we will
need an additional <b>header object</b> so that we can represent empty lists
with something other than <code>null</code>. (Notice that we don't bother to
repeat the specifications from the interface. No need!)
</p>
<pre>
class ImmListImpl implements ImmList {
    private Node head; // may be null to represent empty list

    public ImmListImpl() {
        head = null;
    }
    public boolean empty() {
        return (head == null);
    }
    public Object first() {
        assert head != null;
        return head.data;
    }
    public ImmList rest() {
        assert head != null;
        ImmListImpl r = new ImmListImpl();
        r.head = head.next;
        return r;
    }
    public ImmList cons(Object x) {
        ImmListImpl r = new ImmListImpl();
        r.head = new Node(x, head); // assuming appropriate Node constructor
        return r;
    }

}
</pre>
<p>
Notice that this implementation allows different lists to share the same list
nodes. This makes operations like <code>cons</code> and <code>rest</code> much
more efficient than they otherwise would be; the method <code>rest</code> runs
in constant time rather than needing to copy all the remaining nodes of the list.
It is safe to share list nodes precisely because the list abstraction is
immutable, and the underlying list nodes cannot be accessed by any code outside
the <code>ImmListImpl</code> class. Abstraction lets us build more efficient
code.
</p>

Because <code>ImmList</code> is immutable, it makes sense to have an <code>equals</code>
operation that compares all the corresponding elements:
<pre>
boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!o instanceof ImmList) return false;
    ImmList lst = (ImmList) o;
    Node n = head;
    while (n != null) {
        if (lst.empty()) return false;
        if (!n.data.equals(lst.data)) return false;
        n = n.next;
        lst = lst.rest();
    }
    return lst.empty();
}
</pre>

<h3>Mutable lists</h3>
<p>
The sharing that was possible with immutable lists is necessarily lost when we use
linked lists to implement mutable lists. On the other hand, we can offer a larger
set of operations:
<pre>
/** A mutable ordered list (a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub>) */
interface MutList {
    /** The number of objects in the list. */
    int size();

    /** Returns: The object at index i (a<sub>i</sub>).
     *  Requires: 0 &le; i &lt; n */
    Object get(int i);

    /** Effects: Inserts x at the head of the list. */
    void prepend(Object x);

    /** Effects: Inserts x at the end of the list. */
    void append(Object x);

    /** Returns: true if x is in the list.
     *  Effects: Removes the first occurrence of object x from the list.  */
    boolean remove(Object x);

    /** Returns: true if x is in the list. */
    boolean contains(Object x);

    ...more operations...
}
</pre>
<p>Again, this abstraction can be implemented using a linked list.
A header object is again handy, especially to keep track of auxiliary
information like the number of elements in the list and the last element
of the list.
</p>
<p>We didn't put a <code>rest()</code> operation in the interface,
because it would have to be an O(n) operation. If the client really
wants to perform that computation, they will probably copy the whole
list and remove the first element of the copy.
</p>
<p>Below is the implementation of mutable lists. Notice that <code>prepend</code>
and <code>append</code> both can be implemented to take constant time thanks to
the <code>last</code> field, which avoids scanning down the whole list to find the
end.
</p>
<p>
This code also shows how to find and remove nodes from a linked list. The key is
to keep <i>two</i> pointers into the list, named <code>n</code> and <code>p</code>
in this code, keeping track of the current node and also the previous node. The
previous node is needed because the previous node's <code>next</code> field needs
to point to the next node after the one containing the object we are looking for.
</p>
<pre>
class MList implements MutList {
    private Node head;
    // invariant: size_ is the number of nodes in the list starting with head.
    private int size_;
    // The last element in the list. Is null iff head is null.
    private Node last;

    int size() { return size_; }

    void prepend(Object x) {
        head = new Node(x, head);
        size_++;                        // restore the size_ invariant
    }
    void append(Object x) {
	Node n = new Node(x, null);
	if (head == null)
	    head = last = n;
	else
	    last.next = n;
	size_++;
    }
    boolean remove(Object x) {
        Node n = head, p = null;
        while (n != null && !x.equals(n.data)) {
            p = n;
            n = n.next;
        }
        if (n == null) return false;
        size--;
        if (p == null) head = n.next;
        else p.next = n.next; // splice out n
        return true;
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Abstractions vs data structures</h2>
<img style="float: right" src="lec_recursion_lists/listimpls.png">
<p>
A key thing to observe here is that data structures such as singly or doubly
linked lists are data structures. We can use these data structures to implement
abstractions, such as immutable lists and mutable lists, which provide a
particular set of operations.  There are other ways to implement these
abstractions, however, as we'll see later. And we can use these data
structures, in turn, to implement other abstractions. For example, one useful
abstraction we will see over and over again is the <b>stack</b>. A stack is an
ordered list that supports two operations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>void push(Object x)</code> : insert the element x at the beginning of the list.
<li><code>Object pop()</code> : remove and return the first element in the list. Requires that the stack is non-empty.
</ul>

<p>The stack abstraction is easily and efficiently implemented using linked lists:</p>

<pre>
class Stack {
    private Node top;

    void push(Object x) {
        top = new Node(x, top);
    }
    Object pop() {
        Object ret = top.data;
        top = top.next;
    }
</pre>

<p>The key is to keep in mind that data structures are ways to implement
abstractions, and using them through an abstraction barrier is preferable
to using the data structure directly. This allows you to change the data structure
without breaking client code.</p>

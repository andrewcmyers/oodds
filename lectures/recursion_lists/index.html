<h1>Recursion and linked lists</h1>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>Recursion is the definition of something in terms of itself. This sounds
circular, but with care, recursive definitions can be a highly effective way to
express both algorithms and data structures.
Recursion allows us to solve a problem
by using solutions to “smaller” versions of the same problem.
</p>
<h3>Example: Fibonacci numbers</h3>
<p>
The nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. This is a recursive
definition of a function f(n):
</p>
<blockquote>
\(
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
\)
</blockquote>
<p>
To make this definition make sense, we need a <b>base case</b> that stops
the recursion definition from expanding indefinitely:
</p>
<blockquote>\(
f(0) = 0 \qquad f(1) = 1
\)</blockquote>
<p>
Since the recursive definition is always in terms of smaller values of \(n\), any given 
\( f(n) \) where \( n≥0 \)
expands into smaller and smaller arguments until the base case is reached. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
\(
    f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = (f(1) + f(0)) + f(1) = (1 + 0) + 1 = 2
\)
</blockquote>
<p>
This recursive definition not only makes sense mathematically,
it can be implemented in a direct way as Java code:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="fibo.java">fibo.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
This is very concise code, but not very efficient, as we'll see.
</p>

<h3>Example: Exponentiation</h3>
<p>
An efficient algorithm for exponentiation known as “squaring and multiplication” 
can be implemented recursively in an elegant way.  Algorithms like this one are used
to implement the exponentiation needed by modern cryptography, because the exponents
are too large for the obvious, simple exponentiation algorithm to be practical.
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="Exponentiation.java">Exponentiation.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
It is not difficult to see that this code works correctly.
The base case for the recursion is e = 0, which is clearly computed correctly.
For all other values of e, the expression <code>e/2</code> is smaller than e,
so each recursive call gets closer to the base case and so <code>pow</code>
must terminate. When evaluating whether it works for a given value of
<code>e</code>, we assume that it works for all smaller values of
<code>e</code>, in particular for <code>pow(x, e/2)</code>. Since the expression
<code>e/2</code> computes \( \lfloor e/2 \rfloor \), the
value of <code>h</code> is \(x^{\lfloor e/2 \rfloor}\) according to the
spec for <code>pow</code>. If e is even, then \( \lfloor e/2\rfloor = e/2\), so
<code>h*h</code> is equal to \( (x^{e/2})^2 = x^e\), as
desired. If e is odd, then \(\lfloor e/2\rfloor = (e-1)/2\), so
<code>h*h*x</code> = \(x^{(e-1)} · x = x^e\). So the method works
in either case.
</p>

<h3>Execution of recursive methods</h3>
<p>
Every time a method is invoked, a structure called an <strong>activation record</strong> is
created in the computer's memory, containing all its local variables, including its
parameters. We can represent an activation record in a way similar
to the way we've shown objects, as a box containing variables. (However, it's
not a full-fledged object, because we cannot create a reference to the activation record.)
For example, the diagram
below shows the activation records created during the call <code>pow(2,5)</code>.
Activation records have a pointer to the activation record of the calling method,
shown by a dotted arrow in the diagram. As each recursive call occurs, a new activation
record is created containing new local variables, so that each distinct call has its
own variables.

    retval(sf2, sf1, "4")
    retval(sf1, sf1.ur().toTop(20), "32")

  }


</script>
</div>
<p>
When a method returns, a value is returned to the calling method, as shown by
the numbers beside the dotted arrows. The activation record of the called method
is then destroyed because it is no longer needed.
</p>
<p>
The activation records of a running program form a <b>stack</b>. A stack is an
ordered sequence of items that supports two operations: <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b>.
The <b>push</b> operation puts a new item at the beginning of the sequence and
<b>pop</b> discards the first item in the sequence. The stack of activation
records begins with the current activation record. Each call to a method causes
the creation of a new activation record that is pushed onto the stack. Each
return from a method causes the current activation record to be popped from the
stack. Therefore, activation records are also known as <b>stack frames</b>.
</p>

<h3>Termination and the base case</h3>

<p>
For recursive code to be correct, the base case of the recursion must
eventually be reached on every chain of recursive calls. Just like in the case
of correct loops where we have a decrementing function that gets smaller on
every loop iteration, something must get smaller on every recursive call, until
the base case is reached.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider the problem of determining the number of ways to select
r items from a set of n items. We write this as C(n,r), where C stands for either
<b>choose</b> or <b>combinations</b>. To write the code, we break the problem into
deciding what to do with the first element of the set, and then solving the problem
recursively for the rest of the set. If we choose the first element of the set of n elements,
then there are C(n&minus;1, r&minus;1) ways to pick the remaining elements we need from the rest of
the set. If we don't choose the first element of the set, then there are C(n&minus;1, r) ways
to pick all the r elements from the rest of the set. Therefore, we have the following
equation:
</p>
<div class="figure">
\(
C(n, r) = C(n&minus;1, r&minus;1) + C(n&minus;1, r)
\)
</div>
There are two cases where this equation doesn't hold: when \(r = 0\) and when \(n = r\). In
both those cases, there is only one way to pick the elements, so:
<div class="figure">
\(
C(n, n) = C(n, 0) = 1
\)
</div>
<p>We can view the space of inputs \((n,r)\) as a table, in which the value of each cell
other than the top row and the diagonal is determined by adding the numbers directly
above and diagonally to the left. This gives us Pascal's triangle:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>\(n\)</td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td> 2 </td><td>3 </td><td> 4 </td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(r\)</td><td>0</td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td> 1 </td><td>1 </td><td> 1 </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1</td><td> </td><td>1 </td><td> 2 </td><td>3 </td><td> 4 </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> 1 </td><td>3 </td><td> 6 </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>  </td><td>1 </td><td> 4 </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>  </td><td> </td><td> 1 </td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
As a decrementing function, we can use the value \(\min(n-r, r)\), which measures the closest
distance to one of the two lines of 1's in the table. If this value goes to zero, then
we are in one of the two base cases. Its value decreases by 1 in both recursive calls,
so it can never go below zero. Therefore, the base case must be reached along any chain
of recursive calls.
</p>

<h2>Linked lists</h2>
<p>
We are now going to start talking about <b>data structures</b>, objects
used primarily to store and look up information. Data structures often involve
another kind of recursion: <b>recursion on types</b>.
</p>
<p>
A classic and very useful example of a data structure is the <b>linked list</b>.
A linked list consists of a sequence of <b>node</b> objects in which each node
points to the next node in the list. Some data is stored along with each node.
This data structure can be depicted graphically as shown in this figure, where
the first three prime numbers are stored in the list.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="llist.png" alt="linked list" />
</div>
<p>
The last node in the list does not point to another node; instead, it refers to
the special value <code>null</code> or, alternatively, to a <b>sentinel
object</b> that is used to mark the end of the list.
</p>
<p>
A linked list node is implemented with code like the following:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="Node.java">Node.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the class <code>Node</code> has an instance variable of the same type. That is,
<code>Node</code> is defined in terms of itself. It is an example of a <b>recursive type</b>.
Recursive types are perfectly legal in Java, and very useful.
</p>
<!-- p>
The information in the list may be contained inside the nodes of the linked list, in
which case the list is said to be <b>endogenous</b>, or it may merely be <i>referenced</i> by
the list node, in which case the list is <b>exogenous</b>. We will be working with exogenous
lists here.
</p -->
<p>A sentinel object can be used instead of the special value <code>null</code>,
avoiding the possibility of a null pointer exception:
</p>
<pre>
static Node Null = new Node(); Null.next = Null;
</pre>
<p>
The list shown above is considered a <b>singly linked list</b> because each
list node has one outgoing link. A singly linked list can only be traversed in one direction,
from front to back. It is sometimes helpful to use a
<b>doubly linked list</b> instead, in which each node points to both the
previous and next nodes in the list. In a doubly linked list, it is possible to
walk in both directions, at a cost of more storage to represent the extra links.
</p>
<p>
The definition of a doubly linked list node looks something like the following:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="DNode.java">DNode.java</a>
</pre>
<p>Doubly linked lists come in both linear and circular varieties, as
illustrated below. In the linear variety, the first and last nodes have
null <code>prev</code> and <code>next</code> pointers, respectively. In the
circular variety, no pointers are null. The
head node is distinguished by the fact that
a pointer is kept to it from outside.
The class <code>java.util.LinkedList</code> is actually implemented as a
circular doubly linked list.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="dlist.png" alt="doubly linked list" />
</div>
<h3>Iterative list traversal</h3>
<p>
We can use lists to build many interesting algorithms. Usually we keep some small number of variables
pointing into the list, and follow the pointers between nodes to get around. For example, we can write
code to check whether a list contains an object equal to a particular object <code>x</code>:
</p>
<pre>
boolean contains(Node n, Object x) {
   while (n != null) {
      if (x.equals(n.data)) return true;
      n = n.next;
   }
   return false;
}
</pre>
<p>
We can also scan over a list accumulating information. For example, we might compute the sum of
all the numbers contained in a list of integers:
</p>
<pre>
int sum(Node n) {
   int s = 0;
   while (n != null) {
      s += n.data;
      n = n.next;
   }
   return s;
}
</pre>
<p>or more succinctly,</p>
<pre>
int sum(Node n) {
   int s;
   for (s = 0; n != null; n = n.next) s += n.data;
   return s;
}
</pre>
<p>
Something we often want to do with linked lists is to add a new item into the list.
It is easiest to add at the front of the list because the front of the list is
immediately accessible. This is sometimes called the <b>cons</b> operation, as
in the Lisp language:
</p>
<pre>
Node cons(Object x, Node n) {
   Node ret = new Node();
   ret.data = x;
   ret.next = n;
   return ret;
}
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the new linked list is constructed without making any changes to
the existing nodes. In a sense, we now have two linked lists that happen to share
most of their nodes. As long as we don't make changes to the nodes of either linked
list, this sharing is perfectly okay and something we can exploit for efficiency.
</p>
<p>
If we want to insert at the end of the list, we have to modify the last node.
We can find the last node by scanning down the list until we find it. Or we
can keep track of the last node of the list explicitly.
</p>
<pre>
/** Update the list starting at n to add a node containing x at the end.
 * Requires: n is not null.
 */
void append(Object x, Node n) {
   while (n.next != null)
	  n = n.next;
   n.next = new Node();
   n.next.data = x;
}
</pre>

<h2>Building abstractions using linked lists</h2>
<p>
Linked lists are useful data structures, but using them directly can lead
to programming errors. Often their utility comes from using them to implement
other abstractions.
</p>
<h3>Immutable lists</h3>
<p>
For example, we can use a linked list to efficiently implement an <b>immutable
list</b> of objects:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="ImmList.java">ImmList.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
To implement this interface using a <code>null</code>-terminated list, we will
need an additional <b>header object</b> so that we can represent empty lists
with something other than <code>null</code>. (Notice that we don't bother to
repeat the specifications from the interface. No need!)
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="ImmListImpl.java">ImmListImpl.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Notice that this implementation allows different lists to share the same list
nodes. This makes operations like <code>cons</code> and <code>rest</code> much
more efficient than they otherwise would be; the method <code>rest</code> runs
in constant time rather than needing to copy all the remaining nodes of the list.
It is safe to share list nodes precisely because the list abstraction is
immutable, and the underlying list nodes cannot be accessed by any code outside
the <code>ImmListImpl</code> class. Abstraction lets us build more efficient
code.
</p>
<p>
Because <code>ImmList</code> is immutable, it makes sense to have an <code>equals</code>
operation that compares all the corresponding elements:
</p>
<pre>
boolean equals(Object o) {
   if (!o instanceof ImmList) return false;
   ImmList lst = (ImmList) o;
   Node n = head;
   while (n != null) {
      if (lst.empty()) return false;
      if (!n.data.equals(lst.data)) return false;
      n = n.next;
      lst = lst.rest();
   }
   return lst.empty();
}
</pre>

<h3>Mutable lists</h3>
<p>
The sharing that was possible with immutable lists is necessarily lost when we use
linked lists to implement mutable lists. On the other hand, we can offer a larger
set of operations:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="MutList.java">MutList.java</a>
</pre>
<p>Again, this abstraction can be implemented using a linked list.
A header object is again handy, especially to keep track of auxiliary
information like the number of elements in the list and the last element
of the list.
</p>
<p>We didn't put a <code>rest()</code> operation in the interface,
because it would have to be an O(n) operation. If the client really
wants to perform that computation, they will probably copy the whole
list and remove the first element of the copy.
</p>
<p>Below is the implementation of mutable lists. Notice that <code>prepend</code>
and <code>append</code> both can be implemented to take constant time thanks to
the <code>last</code> field, which avoids scanning down the whole list to find the
end.
</p>
<p>
A final important thing we want to be able to do with mutable lists is to remove a node. For
doubly linked lists, removing nodes is easy, but it is slightly tricky for singly linked lists.
The problem is that when the node is found, the <em>previous</em>
node in the list needs to be updated to point to the next node. The simple loop we've been
using so far will have forgotten what that previous node is. A second wrinkle is that
if the node to be removed is the first node in the list, there <em>is</em> no previous node
to be updated. We can solve this problem by marching two pointers through the list at the same
time. The variable <code>n</code> points to the current node, and the <code>p</code> points
to the previous node, or contains <code>null</code> if <code>n</code> is the first node:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="MList.java">MList.java</a>
</pre>
<h2>Abstract data types vs. data structures</h2>
<!-- this section was not covered during lecture -->
<img style="float: right; padding: 2em" src="listimpls.png" alt="abstraction barrier" />
<p>
A key observation is that singly or doubly
linked lists are concrete data structures. They are implementations of a particular
set of operations. The operations are usually specified in Java by an interface.
The collection of operations and their specifications is called an <b>abstract data type</b> (ADT).
For example, immutable lists and mutable lists are abstract data types, because they
are merely specifications of a collection of operations. These abstract data types can
be implemented by linked lists, but as we will see later on, linked lists are only one of the ways
to implement list abstractions.
</p>
<p>
We can also use data
structures such as linked lists to implement other abstractions.
For example, one useful abstract data type we will see many times over is the <b>stack</b>.
A stack is a list that supports two operations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>void push(Object x)</code>: Insert the element x at the beginning of the list.</li>
<li><code>Object pop()</code>: Remove and return the first element in the list. Requires that the stack is nonempty.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stack ADT is easily and efficiently implemented using linked lists:</p>

<pre class="load">
<a href="Stack.java">Stack.java</a>
</pre>

<p>Keep in mind that data structures are ways to implement
abstract data types, and using them through an abstraction barrier is preferable
to using the data structure directly. This allows you to change the data structure
without breaking client code.</p>

<h2>Recursion on lists</h2>
<p>
The tail of a list is another, smaller list. That means we can write recursive
algorithms that compute over linked lists. For example, we can write the
<code>contains</code> method even more compactly using recursion:
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns whether x is in the list starting at node n. */
boolean contains(Object x, Node n) {
   if (n == null) return false;
   if (x.equals(n.data)) return true;
   return contains(x, n.next);
}
</pre>
<p>
Many different computations on lists can be written recursively, including the <code>sum</code>
method we saw earlier:
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns the sum of the data in the list starting at n. */
int sum(Node n) {
   if (n == null) return 0;
   return n.data + sum(n.next);
}
</pre>
<p>
The code is shorter and simpler than the iterative code. However, it's likely to be a little
bit slower, at least in Java. The reason is that the recursive version creates one
activation record for each list node, but the iterative version uses only one activation
record total.
</p>

<h2>Tail recursion elimination</h2>

<p>
Earlier we saw that we could code up binary search as an iterative algorithm.
We can also implement it recursively, in a way that makes it more obvious why
it works.
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="BinarySearch.java">BinarySearch.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Why does the algorithm work? First, consider the base case, which is when
fst=lst. Since we are assuming that the element k is between fst and lst, it
must be at index lst. Otherwise, the code determines whether the element is
to the left of m (inclusive) or to the right (exclusive), ensuring both that the
precondition of the method is satisfied for the recursive call and that the
distance between fst and lst strictly decreases. It can never decrease below zero,
so the base case is reached eventually.
</p>
<p>
The recursive version of <code>search()</code> above is
a particularly interesting kind of recursive method in that it calls itself as
the very last action. It does not do any computation after the call, but simply
returns the result of the recursive call. Such a call is called a <b>tail call</b>.
A recursive method with only tail calls is said to be <b>tail-recursive</b>.
</p>
<p>
Tail-recursive methods have an interesting property: they are equivalent to
<code>while</code> loops. Any tail-recursive method can be converted to a
<code>while</code> loop and vice versa. The reason this works is that the
activation record for a tail-recursive method is not needed after the call is
made. So the same activation record can be reused for the recursive call. We do not
need a stack of activation records, but can do with just one.
</p>

<p>To convert a tail-recursive method to a <code>while</code> loop, we
wrap the method body in a big <code>while</code> loop with guard <code>true</code>,
then replace each recursive call with assignment statements that reassign
to the method's formal parameters the new values that would have been passed in the recursive call.
Here is what the binary search code looks like after this transformation:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="BinarySearchIterative.java">BinarySearchIterative.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Of course, we can make further simplifications such as folding the base case
into the loop guard.
</p>
<p>
In Java, the iterative version is likely to run more efficiently than the recursive
version, because it requires only one activation record. In some languages, such as
OCaml, the compiler recognizes tail recursion automatically and generates code that
is just as efficient as a loop. Since the transformation to a loop is straightforward,
we can write code using tail recursion when that helps us to get the algorithm right,
and convert it into an efficient loop when necessary for good performance.
</p>

<p>
Another example of a tail-recursive method is the <code>contains</code> method above.
It is tail-recursive because all recursive calls are tail calls. Here is the result
of the transformation to a <code>while</code> loop.
</p>
<pre>
boolean contains(Object x, Node n) {
   while (true) {
      if (n == null) return false;
      if (x.equals(n.data)) return true;
      n = n.next; // x is unchanged in the recursive call
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
As an optimization, we then move the (negated) test <code>n == null</code> into
the loop guard, and put the <code>return false</code> after the loop, to
get exactly the iterative code above!
</p>
<pre>
boolean contains(Object x, Node n) {
   while (n != null) {
      if (x.equals(n.data)) return true;
      n = n.next; // x is unchanged in the recursive call
   }
   return false;
}
</pre>
<p>
The moral is that we can often write short, clear, recursive code and convert it to an
efficient loop when efficiency is paramount.
</p>

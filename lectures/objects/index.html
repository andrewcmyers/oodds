<h1>Values, Types, and Variables</h1>

<h2>Primitive values</h2>
<p>
Programming languages describe computations that compute over <strong>values</strong>. 
These values include <strong>primitive values</strong> such as integers and characters,
which in some sense exist even before programs start running, and <strong>objects</strong>,
which are created by programs as they run.
</p>
<p>
The Java language supports a variety of different primitive values. Each value
has a corresponding <strong>run-time type</strong>. Here are some examples of primitive values:

<p>
An expression like <code>2+3</code> is a <em>computation</em> that produces a
value (5, of course). The expression <code>+</code> is a <strong>binary operator</strong>
(binary, because it takes two arguments). There are also unary operators like
logical negation (<code>!</code>).  For example, <code>!true</code> evaluates
to <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
Java prevents us from writing certain computations that don't make sense. For
example, the expression <code>2 + true</code> would be a <strong>run-time type
error</strong> if allowed to proceed. However, Java will not allow this expression
to be written because it can tell that a run-time type error might (and will,
in this case) result. In fact, run-time type errors are not possible in Java.
For that reason we say that Java is a <strong>strongly typed language</strong>.
</p>
<p>Java has many built-in unary and binary operators, some of which are
rarely used. Some of the commonly used operators are listed here:
</p>

</table>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>
Programming languages let us assign values into variables. For example, assuming we have
variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> of the right type, we can write code like this:
</p>
<pre>
    x = 2;
    y = 2;
    y = y + 1;
</pre>
<p>
We read the equals sign “<code>=</code>” not as &ldquo;equals&rdquo; but as
&ldquo;gets&rdquo; or &ldquo;becomes&rdquo;. This is because the operator is
not testing equality, but rather, changing the value currently in a variable.
Read as an equation, the assignment <code>y = y+1</code> doesn't make much
sense!
</p>
<p>
A good way to understand what is happening when we run programs is to draw an
<strong>object diagram</strong>. There are different styles of object diagrams; below are
two ways to draw what is going in the code above. You can click on the gray play
button in the lower-right corner of the figure to step through the code and see
its effects.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id="var-model-diagrams" style="width: 400px; height: 180px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("var-model-diagrams", true)) {
    setFontSize(12)
    const f1 = addFrame(), f2 = addFrame(), f3 = addFrame().setLength(500),
          xr = varBoxes("x"), yr = varBoxes("y"),
          xv = varBoxes("x=2"), yv = varBoxes("y"),
          l2 = label("2"), l3 = label("3")
    align("center", "none", xr, yr)
    align("center", "none", xv, yv)
    align("distribute", "center", xr, l2, xv)
    align("distribute", "center", yr, l3, yv)
    equal(xr.y0(),20)
    equal(xr.x0(),20)
    equal(xv.x1(),minus(canvasRect().x1(), 1))
    pointer(xr, l2)
    let yrdest = point(l2.x0(), smooth(f3, l2.y(), l3.y()))
    let x3 = average(xr.x(), yrdest.x()), p2 = point(x3, yrdest.y())
    drawAfter(f2, pointer(yr, p2, yrdest))
    pin(yv.center(), drawBetween(f2, f3, label("2")))
    pin(yv.center(), drawAfter(f3, label("3")))
    const code1 = animateCode("*x = 2;", "y = 2;", "y = y + 1;")
    code1.setX(canvasRect().x())
    equal(code1.y0(), plus(20, yr.y1()))
}
</script>
<p>
The view expressed by the picture on the left is that variables contain
<strong>references</strong> to values; the view of the picture on the right is that variables
contain the values themselves. In the view on the left, the variables
x and y are pointing to values that in some sense live outside the computer; we can't
really put the number 2 in the variable x because there is only one 2, and we certainly
don't destroy the number 2 when we assign into y. What is stored
in x is something that represents or names 2. In the view on the right, variables
store values, so we can put the value 2 directly into x. Both views are equally correct in
the sense that they give the same answers if we use either of them to predict what will happen
when we run a program and observe its output. Of course, what <i>actually</i> happens
when we run the program is more complicated than either of these diagrams! So it is
very useful to have a simple model that nevertheless manages to accurately
explain the output we get.
</p>
<p>In practice, people often draw object diagrams using a hybrid approach in
which variables of primitive type are drawn as shown in the diagram on the
right side, whereas variables of object type are drawn as shown in the diagram
on the left. This treats the different types perhaps more differently than
is warranted, but makes the diagrams look as simple as possible. Such hybrid
diagrams also hint at what is going in the underlying implementation of the
programming language, because references to objects are typically more expensive than
references to values of primitive types.
</p>

<h2>Statements vs. expressions</h2>
<p>
The previous example contained a sequence of <strong>assignments</strong> terminated by
semicolons (<code>;</code>). An assignment is an example of a <strong>statement</strong>,
which is a program expression used for its <strong>side effect</strong>
rather than for the
value it computes. For example, the statement <code>x = 2</code> has the
side effect of changing the value of variable <code>x</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike Python, which you might be familiar with, Java is
<strong>whitespace-insensitive</strong>.  This means that whitespace characters such as
spaces, newlines, and tabs are all equivalent to each other (outside of string
and and character literals).  Multiple statements can legally be put on the
same line as long as they are properly terminated with semicolons. However, by
convention we normally have only one statement per line of code, to make code
more readable. Code tends to be read many more times than it is changed, so
readability is very important.
</p>

Java has several different kinds of statements, some of which are listed
here. We see more statement forms later.
<table class=rowlines>
<tr>
<th>Statement syntax</th><th>Meaning</th>
<tr>
<td><code><i>var</i> = <i>expr</i></td>
<td>Assign the value of the expression <i>expr</i> into the variable <i>var</i>
<tr>
<td><code>if (<i>expr</i>) <i>stmt</i></code></td>
<td>A conditional. If expression <i>expr</i> evaluates to <code>true</code>, perform the <strong>consequent</strong> statement <i>stmt</i>.
<tr>
<td><code>if (<i>expr</i>) <i>stmt1</i> else <i>stmt2</i></code>   </td>
<td>If expression <i>expr</i> evaluates to <code>true</code>, perform the statement <code><i>stmt1</i></code>. Otherwise, perform the <strong>alternative</strong> statement <code><i>stmt2</i></code>.
<tr>
<td><code>while (<i>expr</i>) <i>stmt</i></code> <td>A while-loop. If the <strong>guard
expression</strong> <code><i>expr</i></code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, perform
statement <code><i>stmt</i></code>. Then repeat execution of the entire loop.
The loop stops when <code><i>expr</i></code> evaluates to <code>false</code> on any iteration of the loop.
<tr>
<td><code>return <i>expr</i></code>
<td>End the execution of the current method and return the value of
<code><i>expr</i></code> as the value of the method.
</table>

<p>
Many statement forms use special <strong>keywords</strong> such as <code>if</code>,
<code>while</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>return</code>.
Keywords may not be used as the names for variables or for anything else
that the programmer defines.
</p>

<p>
A sequence of statements may be used as a single statement by enclosing it in
<strong>braces</strong> (<code>{...}</code>), and is then called a <strong>block</strong> of
statements.  Just like we use parentheses <code>()</code> to group expressions
that compute values, we can use braces to group statements.  Often people call
them “curly braces” to avoid any confusion with other grouping constructs such
as parentheses <code>(...)</code> or brackets <code>[...]</code> 
(“square brackets”). Code inside braces is indented by convention.
Unlike in Python, indenting code does not have any effect other than 
making it more readable.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose that we want
to swap the values of variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> if
<code>b</code> is larger than <code>a</code>. We can use a conditional
to achieve this goal:
</p>
<pre>
  if (b &gt; a) {
     t = a;
     a = b;
     b = t;
  }
</pre>
<p>
The entire block of statements between the braces is treated as a single
statement that is the consequent of the if-statement.
The if-statement does not need to be terminated in a semicolon because
it ends in a block.
</p>
<div class=exercise>
Notice that this code uses a third variable <code>t</code>. What
is the purpose of this variable?
<p class=answer>
Variable <code>t</code> is used to save the original value of <code>a</code>,
so that it is not lost when <code>a</code> is assigned.
</p>
</div>
<p>
People might format this code according to other styles. For example,
some people put the opening brace <code>{</code> on a line by itself, so that
the two matching braces line up in the same column. Others indent the braces
themselves.  Some people do not put a space after the keyword <code>if</code>,
making it look like a function call.  This text follows the very standard style shown,
called K&amp;R style, after Kernighan and Richie, authors
of <cite>The C Programming Language</cite>. However, professional software engineers
learn to follow whatever style is used by the codebase they are working on,
even if their personal preference differs. Code that is inconsistent about
stylistic conventions is harder to read.
</p>

<h2>Types and declarations</h2>
<p>
Java is a <strong>statically typed language</strong>, which means that the compiler figures
out before the program runs what the type of each variable and expression will be.
This type is the <strong>static</strong> or <strong>compile-time</strong> type.
To help the compiler,
the programmer declares the types of variables.
Java works differently
from <strong>dynamically typed</strong> languages such as Python, where variables do not have a static type
and a single variable can even be used to store values of very different types.
Static types help programmers to write better code and also help the Java compiler to
generate faster code.
</p>
<p>Some languages, such as OCaml, can automatically <strong>infer</strong> static types
for variables, and it turns out that even Java can infer the types of some
variables, as we see later. But for now we write the types explicitly in the code.
</p>
<p>
In Java we write a <strong>variable declaration</strong> by writing the new variable name preceded
by its type, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
int x;
</pre>
<p>
We can both declare a new variable and <strong>initialize</strong> it with a value in one statement:
</p>
<pre>
int y = 1 + 1;
</pre>
<p>Java will let us use the variable <code>y</code> immediately, but will not let us use the
value of variable <code>x</code> until it has been assigned a value.
</p>
<p>If we try to assign a value that is not an <code>int</code> to one of these variables,
such as in the assignment <code>y = true;</code>, it will be a compile-time (static) type error.
The program will not be allowed to run.
</p>
<p>However, Java does allow certain type mismatches to occur, and automatically resolves them
by converting the value to a value of the correct type. If we write:
</p>
<pre>
double z = y;
</pre>
<p class="cont">
then the variable <code>z</code> is initialized to the value 2.0, the closest approximation to
the integer 2 that the type <code>double</code> supports.
<span class=footnote>
Java supports various <strong>implicit conversions</strong> like this one, but they
should be used with care. In particular, the implicit conversion from
<code>int</code> to <code>float</code> (single-precision floating point) is
allowed but can silently lose information.
</span>
</p>

<h2>Defining and calling methods</h2>
<p>
To compute something in Java, we need to put it into a <strong>method</strong>, which
can either define a <strong>function</strong> (which returns a value) or a
<strong>procedure</strong> (which doesn't). For example, if we want to compute the
triple of numbers, we might define a method to do it:
</p>
<pre>
/** Return 3 times n */
int triple(int n) {
    int r = n + n + n;
    return r;
}
</pre>
<p>
Let's dissect this code a bit. We start with a <strong>specification</strong> (or just
<strong>spec</strong>) describing what the method does. The spec is given as a comment that the
Java compiler ignores. However, the Javadoc tool will read the comment and
use it to construct web page documentation for the method. It's a good idea
when writing a method to start with the spec. We'll talk more later about how to
effectively use specs and Javadoc.
</p>
<p>
The expression <code>int triple(int n)</code> is the <strong>signature</strong> of the
method. It starts with the return type (<code>int</code>), and also gives the
types of the expected arguments by declaring a <strong>formal parameter</strong> named
<code>n</code>. A formal parameter (<strong>formal</strong>) is a variable that, when the
method is called, takes on the value of whatever argument value (<strong>actual</strong>)
is provided to the function when the function is <strong>invoked</strong>
(<strong>called</strong>). Since for any given call, the value of the formal is the
argument, it is common to refer interchangeably to both formals and actuals as
“arguments”, but when we want to be precise, the formal parameter is the variable
itself whereas the argument is the value of that variable.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>body</strong> of the method is the part in braces (<tt>{</tt>...<tt>}</tt>).
The body defines what computation is done by the method, and what result
it computes. The body ends in a <code>return</code> statement that
causes the function to produce
the value that its expression <code>n + n + n</code> computes. If we've done
our job correctly, this computation agrees with the spec.
In Java, braces are used as
a way to group one or more statements together, much like parentheses are
used for grouping expressions.
</p>
<p>
We can visualize what happens when this method is called using an object diagram.
Consider the following code:
</p>
<pre>
int y = 1000;
int z = triple(y+1);
</pre>
<p>
The following figure shows what happens as the code executes. Initially only the
variable <code>y</code> exists, with value 1000. When the call to <code>triple</code>
happens, the argument 1001 is first computed. Then, an <strong>activation record</strong>
is created (often called a <strong>stack frame</strong>, though this is really a name for a way to
<em>implement</em> an activation record). The activation record holds all the local variables
for the function being called, which in this case is both the formal parameter <code>n</code>,
bound to the value of the argument 1001, and the local variable <code>r</code>. The desired
result, 3003, is computed and stored into <code>r</code>, and then
the <code>return</code> statement returns this value to the caller. The just-created activation record
is destroyed as the function returns, and the new variable <code>z</code> is initialized in the
activation record of the calling code to the returned result.

          align("abut", "top", v2, hspace().setW(10), ar)
    }
</script>

<h2>Classes and objects</h2>

<p>Objects are unlike primitive values in that programs can create them at run time. The
form of an object is defined by its <strong>class</strong>, which describes the state of the object
and the operations the object supports. For example, suppose we want values that represent
points in the plane. We might define a class <code>Point</code> that describes the objects
that are <strong>instances</strong> of the class:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The class contains two variable definitions. The variables x and y are called
<strong>instance variables</strong>. Each object that is an instance of <code>Point</code> has
its own instance variables x and y. Instance variables are also called <strong>fields</strong>,
a term that was inherited from the C programming language.
</p>
<p>
The <code>new</code> operator is used to create objects. For example, we can create two
point objects that both represent the origin:
</p>
<pre>
Point a = new Point();
Point b = new Point();
</pre>
<p>
Even though these objects represent the same point on the plane, they are
different objects.  We represent this by drawing objects as boxes. Viewed as a
value, the object <i>is</i> the box, so we refer to objects as <strong>boxed
values</strong>, whereas primitive values are <strong>unboxed values</strong>. The object
diagram for the above code shows that we have two distinct values in play:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id="two-points-fig" style="width:330px; height:200px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class="graphics">
    with (new CFigure("two-points-fig", true)) {
        let f1 = addFrame(), f2 = addFrame(), f3 = addFrame()
        let a = varBoxes("a"), b = varBoxes("b"), ab = group(a,b)
            pa = varBoxes("=Point", "x=0", "y=0"),
            pb = varBoxes("=Point", "x", "y")
        align("left", "abut", a, vspace().setH(5), b)
        align("right", "abut", pa, vspace().setH(15), pb)
        align("none", "distribute", pa.getVar(0), ab, pb.getVar(0))
        equal(pa.x0(), plus(ab.x1(), 70))
        equal(ab.x0(), 1)
        pointer(a, point(minus(pa.x0(), 25), pa.getVar(0).y()), pa.getVar(0))
        pointer(b, point(minus(pb.x0(), 25), pb.getVar(0).y()), pb.getVar(0))
        let code = animateCode("b.x = 2", "b.y = b.x + 1") 
        align("none", "bottom", code, pb)
        equal(code.x0(), a.x2())
        drawBefore(f2, label("0").at(pb.getVar(1)))
        drawAfter(f2, label("2").at(pb.getVar(1)))
        drawBefore(f3, label("0").at(pb.getVar(2)))
        drawAfter(f3, label("3").at(pb.getVar(2)))
    }
</script>
<p>
Although the two objects initially have the same state, we can easily distinguish the
two objects. For example, we can assign to the fields of one of the objects:
</p>
<pre>
b.x = 2;
b.y = b.x + 1;
</pre>
<p>Notice that we can name instance variables by using the dot notation to
describe which object's instance variable is being used, and we can both
assign to instance variables and use their values, exactly like regular
variables.
</p>
<p>Each object keeps track of what class it is an instance. This is represented
in the object diagram by putting the class name in the first slot. Because the
object knows its class, it is possible to write code to check whether an object
is of a particular class.
</p>
<p>We can also build objects using other objects. Suppose we want objects
that represent axis-aligned rectangles. We can define such a rectangle in
terms of its lower-left and upper-right corners:
</p>
<pre>
class Rectangle {
    Point LL;
    Point UR;
}
...
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.LL = a
r.UR = b;
</pre>
<p>
Assuming variables a and b are initialized and updated as in the code above, we
arrive at the following object diagram. Notice that the <code>Rectangle</code> object does not
<i>contain</i> the two <code>Point</code> objects; it merely <strong>references</strong> them by containing
<strong>pointers</strong> to the <code>Point</code> objects. Changes
to the point objects through variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will still
affect what rectangle <code>r</code> represents.

<h2>Instance methods</h2>

<p>In addition to instance variables, classes can define methods that provide their
instances with operations. For example, we might want to find the area of a rectangle.
We extend the class definition above accordingly:
</p>
<pre>
class Rectangle {
    Point LL;
    Point UR;
    int area() {
	return (UR.x - LL.x) * (UR.y - LL.y);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In order to invoke this method, we need an instance, which is called the
<strong>receiver object</strong>:
</p>
<pre>
Rectangle r = ...;
int ar = r.area(); // evaluates to 3 on rectangle defined above
</pre>
<p>
Inside the method, we can use the instance variables <code>UR</code> and <code>LL</code>.
These variable names denote the instance variables of the receiver object.
</p>
<p>
Methods do not have to be functions; we can also define methods that are
procedures, used for the side effects they cause. A procedure has a return type
of <code>void</code>.  For example, suppose we want to be able to change
points to be located back at the origin. We can define a procedure
<code>setOrigin</code> that has this effect:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    void setOrigin() {
	x = y = 0; // can cascade assignments and initializations
    }
}
...
Point a = ...;
...
a.setOrigin(); // a refers to the same object, but its
               // instance variables x and y are changed.
</pre>

<h2>Constructors</h2>
<p>
It's awkward and error-prone to initialize the instance variables of
objects only after creating them with <code>new</code>. A better solution is to
define one or more <strong>constructors</strong> that initialize the object to a
&ldquo;good&rdquo; state. Constructors are special methods whose name is
required to be exactly the same as that of the class. A constructor is
called using the <code>new</code> keyword rather by supplying a receiver object.
The constructor then creates the object and initializes it.
</p>
<p>
For example, it would be convenient to be able to create <code>Point</code>
objects that represent the appropriate coordinates immediately, rather than
overwriting the instance variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. An
appropriate constructor would be as follows:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point (int xx, int yy) {
	x = xx;
	y = yy;
    }
    ...
}
...
Point b = new Point(2,3);
</pre>

<p>
When called via the <code>new</code> keyword, a constructor performs the following sequence
of steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the new object to be initialized.
<li>Initialize each instance variable to the default value of its type.
<li>Run the constructor body to complete initialization. Any instance variable
initializers are considered to be part of the constructor body, placed before any
ordinary code in the constructor.
</ol>
<p>
A constructor does have a receiver object, which is the object that is being
constructed.  Inside any method, including constructors, the special expression
<code>this</code> may be used to name the receiver object. An idiomatic use of
the expression <code>this</code> is inside constructors, to allow
distinguishing the instance variables of the object from constructor
parameters. The following constructor behaves exactly like the one just above,
but is more explicit about modifying the receiver object. Notice that the names
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in this code sometimes refers to instance variables of <code>Point</code>
and sometimes refer to the formal parameters.
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point (int x, int y) {
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Class methods</h2>
<p>
Sometimes it is helpful to have methods attached to the class itself, rather
than to its instances.  Such methods are called <strong>class methods</strong> (or
<strong>static methods</strong>). They can be invoked without any receiver object, and
they have no access to the instance variables of a receiver object.  The
expression <code>this</code> cannot be used inside a static method.  A method
is made static by adding the keyword <code>static</code> to its signature. For
example, sometimes it is useful to define static <strong>creator</strong> (or <strong>factory</strong>)
methods to a class:
</p>

<pre>
class Point {
    ...
    static Point zero() {
        return new Point(0,0)
    }
    ...
}
...
Point z = Point.zero()
</pre>

<h2>Running programs: the method <code>main</code></h2>
<p>
A Java program is simply a class with a static method <code>main</code> that
has exactly the following signature:
</p>

<pre>
public static void main(String[] args)
</pre>

<p>
Because it is static, <code>main</code> can be called when no object of its
class is available, including when the program starts running.  Extra arguments
supplied to the program by the operating system, if any, are made available in
the array <code>args</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example, we can write a program that prints &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="Hello.java">Hello.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
    The keyword <code>public</code> in this code is a
    <strong>visibility modifier</strong> that makes the class <code>Hello</code>
    and its method <code>main</code> visible to the entire program.
    We cover visibility modifiers in more detail soon.
</p>
<p>This program can be run using your IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ), which will compile it automatically.
Alternatively, you can run it from a shell such as <tt>bash</tt>
(or, on Windows, <tt>cmd</tt> or Powershell, where the prompt 
will be <kbd>&gt;</kbd> instead of <kbd>$</kbd>):
</p>
<pre>
$ javac Hello.java    # Compile the program by specifying the source files
$ java Hello          # Run the program, naming the main class of the program.
Hello World!
</pre>


<h2>Names and scope</h2>
<p>
Names can refer to a variety of things: local variables (including the formal
parameters of methods), instance fields, methods, types, classes, and packages.
The basic rule for deciding what kind of thing a name refers to is to find the
definition of the name with the smallest <em>scope</em> that includes the use
of the name. Different kinds of names have different rule for scope.  Local
variables are in scope from the point of declaration until the end of the block
in which they are declared. Names of instance methods and instance variables
names are in scope in non-static contexts throughout their class, but are out
of scope in static contexts such as static methods.  Class and interface names
are in scope throughout the program unless they are nested inside another
class, in which case they are in scope throughout the containing class. (In
addition, their scope is controlled by visibility modifiers such as
<code>public</code>.)
</p>
<p>
If a name is in the scope of two different declarations at once, the outer declaration
is said to be <em>shadowed</em> by the inner one. The scope of the outer declaration has
a “hole” in it where the inner scope exists. Java considers some shadowing to be
illegal. For example, this code will not compile because the variable <code>x</code>
is shadowed inside the <code>while</code> loop:
</p>
<pre>
int x = 2;
while (x != 0) {
    int x = 5;
    // shadowing of outer x by inner x is illegal here
}
// only outer x in scope here.
</pre>
<p>
Local variables cannot have a hole in scope, but one place where shadowing
<em>is</em> allowed, often getting programmers into trouble, is when a local
variable shadows an instance variable. Shadowing is especially common with
constructors, because it is convenient to name formal parameters in the same
way as corresponding instance variables:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point(int x, int y) {
	// locals x and y shadow instance variables x and y
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
As the example shows, there <i>is</i> a way to talk about shadowed instance
variables, using the object reference <code>this</code>. The expression
<code>this</code> can only be used inside instance methods (not static methods)
and refers to the current object: in this case, the object being
constructed. Alternatively, you can give the formal parameters different names
(for example, by appending an underscore), and then the instance variables can
be used directly, without using "<code>this</code>".

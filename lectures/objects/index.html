<h1>Objects and Values</h1>

<h2>Primitive values</h2>
<p>
Programming languages describe computations that compute over <em>values</em>. 
These values include <em>primitive values</em> such as integers and characters,
which in some sense exist even before programs start running, and <em>objects</em>,
which are created by programs as they run.
</p>
<p>
The Java language supports a variety of different primitive values. Each value
has a corresponding <em>run-time type</em>. Here are some examples of primitive values:
</p>

    <td>A single-precision floating point number, with about 7 digits of precision.
	Usually to be avoided because of its limited accuracy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>(null)</td>
    <td><code>null</code></td>
    <td><code>null</code> is the only primitive value that can be used where an object is
	expected. It is generally used to represent the absence of an object value.
	Its run-time type does not have a corresponding name as a Java type.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
An expression like <code>2+3</code> is a <em>computation</em> that produces a value
(5, of course). The expression <code>+</code> is a <em>binary operator</em> (binary, because it
takes two arguments). There are also unary operators like logical negation (<code>!</code>).
For example, <code>!true</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
Java prevents us from writing certain computations that don't make sense. For
example, the expression <code>2 + true</code> would be a <em>run-time type
error</em> if allowed to proceed. However, Java will not allow this expression to
be written because it can tell that a run-time type error might (and will, in this case)
result. In fact, run-time type errors are not possible in Java. For that reason we
say that Java is a <em>strongly typed language</em>.
</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>
Programming languages let us assign values into variables. For example, assuming we have
variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> of the right type, we can write code like this:
</p>
<pre>
    x = 2;
    y = 2;
    y = y + 1;
</pre>
<p>
We read the equals sign &ldquo;=&rdquo; not as &ldquo;equals&rdquo; but as
&ldquo;gets&rdquo; or &ldquo;becomes&rdquo;. This is because the operator is
not testing equality, but rather, changing the value currently in a variable.
We can see this because as an equation, <code>y = y+1</code> doesn't make much sense!
</p>
<p>
A useful way to understand what is happening when we run Java programs is to
draw an <em>object diagram</em>. There are different styles of object diagrams;
here are two ways to draw what is going in the code above (click on the "play button"
in the figure to step through the code and see its effects):
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id="var-model-diagrams" style="width: 400px; height: 180px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("var-model-diagrams", true)) {
    setFontSize(12)
    const f1 = addFrame(), f2 = addFrame(), f3 = addFrame().setLength(500),
          xr = varBoxes("x"), yr = varBoxes("y"),
          xv = varBoxes("x=2"), yv = varBoxes("y"),
          l2 = label("2"), l3 = label("3")
    align("center", "none", xr, yr)
    align("center", "none", xv, yv)
    align("distribute", "center", xr, l2, xv)
    align("distribute", "center", yr, l3, yv)
    equal(xr.y0(),20)
    equal(xr.x0(),20)
    equal(xv.x1(),minus(canvasRect().x1(), 1))
    pointer(xr, l2)
    let yrdest = point(l2.x0(), smooth(f3, l2.y(), l3.y()))
    let x3 = average(xr.x(), yrdest.x()), p2 = point(x3, yrdest.y())
    drawAfter(f2, pointer(yr, p2, yrdest))
    pin(yv.center(), drawBetween(f2, f3, label("2")))
    pin(yv.center(), drawAfter(f3, label("3")))
    const code1 = animateCode("*x = 2;", "y = 2;", "y = y + 1;")
    code1.setX(canvasRect().x())
    equal(code1.y0(), plus(20, yr.y1()))
}
</script>
<p>
The view expressed by the picture on the left is that variables contain
<em>references</em> to values; the view of the picture on the right is that variables
contain the values themselves. In the view on the left, the variables
x and y are pointing to values that in some sense live outside the computer; we can't
really put the number 2 in the variable x because there is only one 2, and we certainly
don't destroy the number 2 when we assign into y. What is stored
in x is something that represents or names 2. In the view on the right, variables
store values, so we can put the value 2 directly into x. Both views are equally correct in
the sense that they give the same answers if we use either of them to predict what will happen
when we run a program and observe its output. Of course, what <i>actually</i> happens
when we run the program is more complicated than either of these diagrams! So it is
very useful to have a simple model that nevertheless manages to accurately
explain the output we get.
</p>
<p>In practice, people often draw object diagrams using a hybrid approach in
which variables of primitive type are drawn as shown in the diagram on the
right side, whereas variables of object type are drawn as shown in the diagram
on the left. This treats the different types perhaps more differently than
is warranted, but makes the diagrams look as simple as possible. Such hybrid
diagrams also hint at what is going in the underlying implementation of the
programming language, because references to objects are typically more expensive than
references to values of primitive types.
</p>

<h2>Types and declarations</h2>
<p>
Java is a <em>statically typed language</em>, which means that the compiler tries to figure
out before the program runs what the type of each expression will be. To help it do this,
the programmer is required to declare the type of all variables. (Some languages, such as
OCaml, actually can automatically <em>infer</em> the types of variables.) This is different
from <em>dynamically typed</em> languages such as Python, where variables do not have a static type
and can even be used to store values of different types.
</p>
<p>
In Java we can write a <em>variable declaration</em> by writing the new variable name preceded
by its type, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
int x;
</pre>
<p>
We can both declare a new variable and <em>initialize</em> it with a value in one statement:
</p>
<pre>
int y = x + 1;
</pre>
<p>Java will let us use the variable <code>y</code> immediately, but will not let us use the
value of variable <code>x</code> until it has been assigned a value.
</p>
<p>If we try to assign a value that is not an <code>int</code> to one of these variables,
such as in the assignment <code>y = true;</code>, it will be a compile-time (static) type error.
The program will not be allowed to run.
</p>
<p>However, Java does allow certain type mismatches to occur, and automatically resolves them
by converting the value to a value of the correct type. If we write:
</p>
<pre>
double z = y;
</pre>
<p class="cont">
then the variable <code>z</code> is initialized to the value 2.0, the closest approximation to
the integer 2 that the type <code>double</code> supports.
</p>

<h2>Defining and calling methods</h2>
<p>
To compute something in Java, we need to put it into a <em>method</em>, which
can either define a <em>function</em> (which returns a value) or a
<em>procedure</em> (which doesn't). For example, if we want to compute the
triple of numbers, we might define a method to do it:
</p>
<pre>
/** Return 3 times n */
int triple(int n) {
    int r = n + n + n;
    return r;
}
</pre>
<p>
Let's dissect this a bit. We start with a <em>specification</em> (or just
<em>spec</em>) describing what the method does. This is a comment that the
Java compiler ignores. However, the Javadoc tool will read the comment and
use it to construct web page documentation for the method. It's a good idea
when writing a method to start with the spec. We'll talk more later about how to
effectively use specs and Javadoc.
</p>
<p>
The expression <code>int triple(int n)</code> is the <em>signature</em> of the
method. It starts with the return type (<code>int</code>), and also gives the
types of the expected arguments. The <em>formal parameter</em> (or just
<em>formal</em>) <code>n</code> takes on the value of whatever argument (aka
<em>actual</em>) is provided to the function when the function is <em>invoked</em>
(aka <em>called</em>). The <em>body</em> of the method is the part in braces (<tt>{</tt>...<tt>}</tt>).
The body defines what computation is done by the method.
The
bolded <em>keyword</em> <code>return</code> causes the function to produce
the value that its expression <code>n + n + n</code> computes. If we've done
our job correctly, this computation agrees with the spec.
Note that in Java, braces (&ldquo;{&rdquo; and &ldquo;}&rdquo;) are used as
a way to group one or more statements together, much like parentheses are
used for grouping expressions.
</p>
<p>
We can visualize what happens when this method is called using an object diagram.
Consider the following code:
</p>
<pre>
int y = 1000;
int z = triple(y+1);
</pre>
<p>
The following figure shows what happens as the code executes. Initially only the
variable <code>y</code> exists, with value 1000. When the call to <code>triple</code>
happens, the argument 1001 is first computed. Then, an <em>activation record</em>
is created (often called a <em>stack frame</em>, though this is really a name for a way to
<i>implement</i> an activation record). The activation record holds all the local variables
for the function being called, which in this case is both the formal parameter <code>n</code>,
bound to the value of the argument 1001, and the local variable <code>r</code>. The desired
result, 3003, is computed and stored into <code>r</code>, and then
the <code>return</code> statement returns this value to the caller. The just-created activation record
is destroyed as the function returns, and the new variable <code>z</code> is initialized in the
activation record of the calling code to the returned result.

          align("abut", "top", v2, hspace().setW(10), ar)
    }
</script>

<h2>Classes and objects</h2>

<p>Objects are unlike primitive values in that programs can create them at run time. The
form of an object is defined by its <em>class</em>, which describes the state of the object
and the operations the object supports. For example, suppose we want values that represent
points in the plane. We might define a class <code>Point</code> that describes the objects
that are <em>instances</em> of the class:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The class contains two variable definitions. The variables x and y are called
<em>instance variables</em>. Each object that is an instance of <code>Point</code> has
its own instance variables x and y. Instance variables are also called <em>fields</em>,
a term that was inherited from the C programming language.
</p>
<p>
The <code>new</code> operator is used to create objects. For example, we can create two
point objects that both represent the origin:
</p>
<pre>
Point a = new Point();
Point b = new Point();
</pre>
<p>
Even though these objects represent the same point on the plane, they are
different objects.  We represent this by drawing objects as boxes. Viewed as a
value, the object <i>is</i> the box, so we refer to objects as <em>boxed
values</em>, whereas primitive values are <em>unboxed values</em>. The object
diagram for the above code shows that we have two distinct values in play:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id="two-points-fig" style="width:330px; height:200px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class="graphics">
    with (new CFigure("two-points-fig", true)) {
        let f1 = addFrame(), f2 = addFrame(), f3 = addFrame()
        setFontName("consolas, fixed")
        let a = varBoxes("a"), b = varBoxes("b"), ab = group(a,b)
            pa = varBoxes("=Point", "x=0", "y=0"),
            pb = varBoxes("=Point", "x", "y")
        align("left", "abut", a, vspace().setH(5), b)
        align("right", "abut", pa, vspace().setH(15), pb)
        align("none", "distribute", pa.getVar(0), ab, pb.getVar(0))
        equal(pa.x0(), plus(ab.x1(), 70))
        equal(ab.x0(), 1)
        pointer(a, point(minus(pa.x0(), 25), pa.getVar(0).y()), pa.getVar(0))
        pointer(b, point(minus(pb.x0(), 25), pb.getVar(0).y()), pb.getVar(0))
        let code = animateCode("b.x = 2", "b.y = b.x + 1") 
        align("none", "bottom", code, pb)
        equal(code.x0(), a.x2())
        drawBefore(f2, label("0").at(pb.getVar(1)))
        drawAfter(f2, label("2").at(pb.getVar(1)))
        drawBefore(f3, label("0").at(pb.getVar(2)))
        drawAfter(f3, label("3").at(pb.getVar(2)))
    }
</script>
<p>
Although the two objects initially have the same state, we can easily distinguish the
two objects. For example, we can assign to the fields of one of the objects:
</p>
<pre>
b.x = 2;
b.y = b.x + 1;
</pre>
<p>Notice that we can name instance variables by using the dot notation to
describe which object's instance variable is being used, and we can both
assign to instance variables and use their values, exactly like regular
variables.
</p>
<p>Each object keeps track of what class it is an instance. This is represented
in the object diagram by putting the class name in the first slot. Because the
object knows its class, it is possible to write code to check whether an object
is of a particular class.
</p>
<p>We can also build objects using other objects. Suppose we want objects
that represent axis-aligned rectangles. We can define such a rectangle in
terms of its lower-left and upper-right corners:
</p>
<pre>
class Rectangle {
    Point LL;
    Point UR;
}
...
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.LL = a
r.UR = b;
</pre>
<p>
Assuming variables a and b are initialized and updated as in the code above, we
arrive at the following object diagram. Notice that the <code>Rectangle</code> object does not
<i>contain</i> the two <code>Point</code> objects; it merely <em>references</em> them by containing
<em>pointers</em> to the <code>Point</code> objects. Changes
to the point objects through variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will still
affect what rectangle <code>r</code> represents.

            pointer(rect.getVar(2), pb.getVar(0).toLeft(40), pb.getVar(0)))
        
    }
</script>

<h2>Instance methods</h2>

<p>In addition to instance variables, classes can define methods that provide their
instances with operations. For example, we might want to find the area of a rectangle.
We extend the class definition above accordingly:
</p>
<pre>
class Rectangle {
    Point LL;
    Point UR;
    int area() {
	return (UR.x - LL.x) * (UR.y - LL.y);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In order to invoke this method, we need an instance, which is called the
<em>receiver object</em>:
</p>
<pre>
Rectangle r = ...;
int ar = r.area(); // evaluates to 3 on rectangle defined above
</pre>
<p>
Inside the method, we can use the instance variables <code>UR</code> and <code>LL</code>.
These variable names denote the instance variables of the receiver object.
</p>
<p>Methods do not have to be functions; we can also define methods that are procedures,
used for the <em>side effects</em> they cause. A procedure has a return type of <code>void</code>.
For example, suppose we want to be able to change <code>Point</code>s to be back at the origin:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    void setOrigin() {
	x = y = 0; // can cascade assignments and initializations
    }
}
...
Point a = ...;
...
a.setOrigin(); // a refers to the same object, but its
               // instance variables x and y are changed.
</pre>

<h2>Constructors</h2>
<p>
It's awkward and error-prone to have to initialize the instance variables of
objects after creating them with <code>new</code>. A better solution is to
define one or more <em>constructors</em> that initialize the
object to a &ldquo;good&rdquo; state. Constructors are methods whose name is
exactly the same as that of the class.
</p>
<p>
For example, it would be convenient to be able to create <code>Point</code>
objects to represent the appropriate coordinates directly. An appropriate
constructor would be as follows:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point (int xx, int yy) {
	x = xx;
	y = yy;
    }
    ...
}
...
Point b = new Point(2,3);
</pre>

<p>A constructor has a receiver object, which is the object that is being constructed.
Inside any method, including constructors, the special expression
<code>this</code> may be used to name the receiver object. An idiomatic use of the
expression <code>this</code> is inside constructors, to allow distinguishing the
instances variables of the object from constructor parameters:
<pre>
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point (int x, int y) {
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Class methods</h2>
<p>
Sometimes it is helpful to have methods attached to the class itself, rather
than to its instances.  Such methods are called <em>class methods</em> (or
<em>static methods</em>). They can be invoked edithout any receiver object, and
they have no access to the instance variables of a receiver object.  The
expression <code>this</code> cannot be used inside a static method.  A method
is made static by adding the keyword <code>static</code> to its signature. For
example, sometimes it is useful to define static <em>creator</em> (or <em>factory</em>)
methods to a class:
</p>

<pre>
class Point {
    ...
    static Point zero() {
        return new Point(0,0)
    }
    ...
}
...
Point z = Point.zero()
</pre>

<h2>The main method</h2>
<p>
A Java program is simply a class with a static <code>main</code> method with
exactly the following signature:
</p>

<pre>
public static void main(String[] args);
</pre>

<p>
Because it is static, <code>main</code> can be called when no object of its class is
available. Extra arguments supplied to the program by the operating
system are made available in the array <code>args</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example, we can write a program that prints &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="objects/Hello.java">Hello.java</a>
</pre>
<p>This program can be run using your IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ), which will compile it automatically.
Alternatively, you can run it from a shell such as <tt>bash</tt>
(or, on Windows, <tt>cmd</tt> or <tt>Powershell</tt>, where the prompt <tt>$</tt>
will be a <tt>&gt;</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
$ javac Hello.java    # Compile the program by specifying the source files
$ java Hello          # Run the program, naming the main class of the program.
Hello World!
</pre>

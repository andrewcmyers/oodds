<h1>Interfaces and subtyping</h1>

<p>
The word “interface” has more than one meaning. In the context of computer
science generally, it refers to a description or specification of the way that
program modules interact with one another, or the way that client code interacts
with a program module. In the context of Java,
“interface” refers to a language feature that allows programmers to create
interfaces for classes, which are a module mechanism. An interface describes a
set of public methods that must be provided by the class; when using the class
via the interface; only these public methods can be used. The interface
includes the name and signature of the methods; it's also a good place to write
specifications for those methods.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
For example, suppose that we want to implement the <a
href="http://2048game.com">2048 game</a>, a popular game for cell phones
consisting of movable numbered tiles in a 4&times;4 grid.  We want to
keep track of the state of the game at any given point and allow the
user to make moves in the game.</p>

<p>
Let's define an interface to the game. We'll call it <code>Board</code>:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="Board.java">Board.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
Notice that this interface says nothing about how the various methods
are implemented or about how the game information is represented inside
objects. The interface doesn't say that the methods are public, because
interface methods are always public.
</p>

<p>
The method <code>move()</code> uses a feature we haven't seen yet:
<code>enum</code> (enumeration) types.
The type <code>Direction</code> is declared
as follows:
<pre class="load">
<a href="Direction.java">Direction.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
This type has exactly the four specified values <code>UP</code>,
<code>DOWN</code>, <code>LEFT</code>, and <code>RIGHT</code>. Of course,
we could encode the four directions using a another type such as
numbers or characters, but when used appropriately, using an <code>enum</code>
makes code easier to read and less error-prone.
</p>

<h3>Smoe implementations</h3>
<p>
The <code>Board</code> interface can be implemented by defining a class
that is declared to implement it using the <code>implements</code>
keyword. Now we must make some implementation choices, such as how
to represent the tiles of the game. One obvious representation is as a
two-dimensional array of integers, with 0 representing blank tiles:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="ABoard.java">ABoard.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
There are few interesting aspects of this code. First, notice that each method
declared in the interface must be implemented as a <code>public</code> method
in the class. The class has some other components as well. For example, the
instance variables <code>tiles</code> and <code>score</code> are declared
<code>private</code> to hide them from clients. A class can also add new
methods not declared in the interface, such as the <code>ABoard()</code>
constructor.
</p>
<p>
We can define an interface (in the general sense) to a class either by
declaring which of its methods are public, or by declaring a Java interface
as above. One advantage of using the interface mechanism is that it allows
<em>multiple</em> implementations of the interface.
</p>
<p>
The code also shows how to use a <code>switch</code> statement to
execute different code based on the value of an expression. These
statements are particularly useful in combination with <code>enum</code>
types, because they make it easy to check that all possible values have
been covered by some <code>case</code>. Notice that each <code>case</code>
should be terminated by a <code>break</code> statement; Java unfortunately
inherits the C semantics of <code>switch</code>, in which each case
falls through into the code of the next case unless some statement,
such as a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code>,
stops the execution of the <code>switch</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example,  here is a sketch of a second implementation of the <code>Board</code> in which the <code>Board</code> keeps track of the positions of the tiles
rather than what tile is located at each position.

<pre class="load">
<a href="TBoard.java">TBoard.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
The method <code>tile()</code> becomes more complicated because the
code has to search for a title at the specified location. When it finds
such a tile, the method returns immediately. If no matching tile is
found, it returns zero.
</p>

<p>
And here is a third implementation 
which the tiles are represented as characters in a string, aiming for
efficient use of the computer's memory:
</p>

<pre class="load">
<a href="SBoard.java">SBoard.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
As we can see, even a simple abstraction like <code>Board</code> has a variety
of implementations, with different tradeoffs in simplicity of code, running
time, and space used. If the rest of the code accessing the board through the
interface <code>Board</code>, the code has loose coupling. We can easily change
to another implementation of Board if we gain better understanding of these
tradeoffs. For example, a search algorithm to suggest the next move might need
to allocate a large number of board objects; in that case, we would likely
prefer the space-efficient  implementation <code>SBoard</code>.
</p>

<h3>Using objects at type Board</h3>

<p>
We now have three implementations of <code>Board</code>. The important new
capability that is added is that client code can be written that does not care
which implementation is being used. For example, suppose we want to write a method
that displays a game board. That code can be written so it works on objects from
either implementation:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="Display.java">display.java</a>
</pre>
<p>The client code can use <code>display()</code> on either kind of object, because
both <code>ABoard</code> and <code>SBoard</code> are implementations of <code>Board</code>.
</p>

<p>
As long as <code>ABoard</code> and <code>SBoard</code> are implemented correctly, the code of
<code>display()</code> cannot tell which implementation is being used. That is
why <code>display()</code> can be used on objects of either kind.  The
abstraction barrier imposed by the <code>Board</code> interface allows the programmer to
start with one implementation and later to replace it with a different
implementation, with confidence that it won't break the program.
</p>
<p>
When compiling the method call <code>p.tile(r, c)</code> in the method
<code>display(Board b)</code>, the compiler does not know which method code it
is going to run. The variable <code>p</code> can refer to either an
<code>ABoard</code> object or an <code>SBoard</code> object (or maybe some
other implementation of <code>Board</code> altogether). In general, the
compiler cannot figure out ahead of time which one it will be. The call to
<code>p.tile(r, c)</code> must find the correct method implementation at run
time. It does this by checking the dynamic type (aka run-time type) of the
object <code>p</code>. The dynamic or run-time type of an object is the class
that was named when the object was created via <code>new</code>. This is called
<b>dynamic dispatch</b>.
</p>

<h2>Classes vs. types</h2>
<p>
In Java programs, each object has a <strong>dynamic</strong> or
<strong>run-time</strong> type. The dynamic type is the name of the class that
was specified in the <code>new</code> statement when the object was created.
The dynamic type is associated with the object at birth and stays with it
unchanged throughout its lifetime.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, expressions in the Java language have
<strong>static</strong> types that they obtain by declaration of variables. The
static type of a variable is the type given to it in its declaration. (Note
that this usage of the term <strong>static</strong> is not related to the Java
keyword <code>static</code> used to declared static fields and methods.)</p>

<p> 
Both interface names like <code>Board</code> and class names like
<code>ABoard</code> and <code>SBoard</code> may be used as static types in Java
programs, but only class names may be used
as dynamic types. The dynamic type of an object can never be <code>Board</code>; it is always
the class of the object that was provided to the <code>new</code> operator when the object was
created.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following code. The first line creates an object with dynamic type
<code>ABoard</code> and assigns it to a variable of static type <code>ABoard</code>. The second
line assigns the same object to a variable of static type <code>Board</code>. This is allowed
because <code>ABoard</code> is an implementation of <code>Board</code>. The third line tries to
use the interface <code>Board</code> with the operator <code>new</code>. This is illegal, because
<code>Board</code> is not a class; the compiler doesn't know what implementation to use.
</p>
<pre>
ABoard a = new ABoard(); // ok
Board b = a; // ok
Board p = new Board();  // illegal
</pre>
<p>
This shows that both class and interface names may be used as static types in Java, but only class names
may be used as dynamic types.
</p>

<h2>Subtyping and subtype polymorphism</h2>
<p>
Because <code>ABoard</code> implements <code>Board</code>, an expression of
static type <code>ABoard</code> can always be used where a
<code>Board</code> is expected. This is an example of a <b>subtype</b> relationship
between two types. We write <code>ABoard</code> &lt;: <code>Board</code> to
mean that the type <code>ABoard</code> is a subtype of the type
<code>Board</code>. (Sometimes you will see this written as <code>ABoard</code> ≤ <code>Board</code>.)
Since an <code>SBoard</code> can also be used wherever a
<code>Board</code> is expected, the subtype relationship
<code>SBoard</code> &lt;: <code>Board</code> also holds.
</p>
<p>
The subtyping relationships among the various types form a <b>type hierarchy</b>
(or <b>subtype hierarchy</b>), an example of which is shown in this figure:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id=subtype_hierarchy style="width:400px; height: 180px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  with (new CFigure("subtype_hierarchy")) {
    setFontName("Menlo, consolas, fixed")
    setFontSize(11)
    addFrame()
    let l_int, l_obj = label("Object")
    align("distribute", "bottom", l_obj, hspace().setW(0), label("char"), label("boolean"), l_int = label("int"))
    align("right", "top", l_int, canvasRect())
    align("center", "top", l_obj, canvasRect())
    let l_Integer = label("Integer"),
        l_String = label("String"),
        l_intarray = label("int[]"),
        l_collection = label("Collection<Object>"),
        tier2 = group(l_Integer, l_String, l_intarray, l_collection)
    align("distribute", "bottom", tier2.objects)
    align("center", "none", l_obj, tier2)
    align("left", "none", tier2, canvasRect())
    align("right", "none", tier2, canvasRect())
    let l_Board = label("Board")
    equal(l_Board.y0(), plus(24, l_String.y1()))
    equal(l_Board.x(), average(l_String.x1(), l_intarray.x0()));
    [l_Integer, l_String, l_intarray, l_collection, l_Board].forEach(o =>
        connector(l_obj.lc().toBottom(4), o.uc()).setEndArrow("arrow")
    )
    let lA = label("ABoard"), lS = label("SBoard")
    let tier3 = group(lA, hspace().setW(40), lS).align("abut", "bottom").setX(l_Board.x())
    align("none", "bottom", tier3, canvasRect());

    [lA, lS].forEach(o =>
        connector(l_Board.lc().toBottom(4), o.uc()).setEndArrow("arrow"))
  }
</script>
</div>
<p>
In addition to the subtype relationships we've discussed so far, this diagram shows a few
more, such as <code>Board</code> &lt;: <code>Object</code>. 
The subtyping relation is reflexive (\(T&lt;:T\) for all types T) and is also transitive
(if \(T&lt;:U\) and \(U&lt;:V\), then \(T&lt;:V\)).)
Thus by transitivity, we also have <code>ABoard</code> &lt;: <code>Object</code>.
We can also notice that array types like <code>int[]</code> are subtypes of <code>Object</code>.
Standing alone in the diagram are the primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>char</code>, ...). These types are not subtypes of any other type.
</p>
<p>In the diagram above, every type has at most one parent, making this diagram a
collection of trees (a <b>forest</b>). However, a class is allowed to implement more than
one interface, as in the following definition:
</p>
<pre>
class SBoard implements Board, Collection&lt;Integer&gt; {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p class="cont">
so in general the subtype diagram is a graph in which some nodes have
more than one ancestor.
</p>

<p>If static type checking is doing its job, then the following invariant should always hold
throughout execution is:</p>
<blockquote>
The dynamic type of the value of an expression is always a subtype of the static type of the expression.
</blockquote>
<p>
In particular, whenever a variable references an object, the dynamic type of
the object is a subtype of the declared type of the variable.
</p>
<p>
However, Java has some unsafe features that can break this invariant. These features should be avoided
when possible!
</p>

<h2>Subtyping vs. coercion</h2>
<p>
Java lets us write the following declaration, which might make us think
incorrectly that <code>int</code> &lt;: <code>Object</code>:
</p>
<pre>
Object x = 2;
</pre>
<p>
Although this looks like subtyping, actually Java is automatically inserting a <b>coercion</b> (a conversion)
to make the types work.  The variable <code>x</code> is not being
assigned the value appearing on the right-hand side, but rather an object of
type <code>Integer</code> that is created automatically. The declaration is syntactic sugar for this one:
<code>Object x = Integer.valueOf(2)</code>. This mechanism is known as <strong>autoboxing</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>
With subtyping, a given value can be treated as though it has more than one
type. (When a value can have more than one type, it is called
<b>polymorphism</b>, and the kind of polymorphism we get with
subtyping is called <b>subtype polymorphism</b>.)
</p>
<p>
Java's <b>cast</b> operator can be used to control the compile-time type at
which a value is used. A cast does not affect the run-time type of the value,
only the type which the compiler will treat the value as belonging to.
As an example, suppose we have a variable <code>a</code> of type
<code>ABoard</code>.  To force it to be treated as a <code>Board</code>, we
write a <b>cast expression</b>: <code>(Board) a</code>.  Since <code>ABoard</code> is a subtype of
<code>Board</code>, this cast will always succeed at run time: it is
<b>type-safe</b>. We refer to this kind of cast as an <b>upcast</b> because it
shifts the type upward in the type hierarchy. In fact, it is not normally necessary to
write a cast operation, since the language will automatically treat a subtype
value as belonging to the supertype when necessary.  Occasionally it is useful
to write an explicit upcast when debugging.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to cast downward in the subtype hierarchy. This gives us a <b>downcast</b>,
an unsafe cast that can fail at run time. For example, consider this code:
</p>
<pre>
ABoard a = new ABoard();
Board p = a;
ABoard a2 = (ABoard) p;
</pre>
<p>
Here, all three variables refer to the same underlying <code>ABoard</code> object.
The downcast to <code>a2</code> succeeds at run time because the dynamic type of the object
is a subtype of the type it is being cast to. On the other hand, if we had reassigned
the variable <code>p</code> to refer to an <code>SBoard</code> object, the downcast
would fail with a <code>ClassCastException</code>.
</p>
<p>
A downcast should ordinarily be used only when it is guaranteed to succeed, so
a failed downcast generally means that the programmer has made a mistake. It is
possible to test in advance whether a downcast will succeed by using the <code>instanceof</code>
operator to test the run-time type of the object.
</p>
<pre>
Board p = ...;
if (p instanceof ABoard) {
    ABoard a2 = (ABoard) p;
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>In recent versions of Java, it is possible to avoid writing an explicit cast by
introducing a variable in the instanceof expression itself:
<pre>
Board p = ...;
if (p instanceof ABoard a2) {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Downcasting and <code>instanceof</code> are sometimes necessary, but excessive
use of these operations is a danger sign that your code is not well designed.
If you find yourself using them a lot, it is worth thinking about whether there
is a way to redesign your code to avoid them.
</p>
<p>
Upcasting to a supertype can sometimes be used as a form of information hiding.
Upcasting to a supertype hides operations not present in the supertype,
although not as completely as using private visibility. The corresponding
downcast can be used to restore access to these operations if desired, so the
abstraction barrier is porous.  In general, it is good form to work with the
narrowest interface that still allows the desired operations to be performed.
Often this means accessing objects only through the interfaces they implement
rather than through their classes.
</p>

<h2>Interface subtyping</h2>
<p>
An interface can <code>extend</code> another interface, creating a subtyping relationship.
For example, we might want a board interface that adds a method for automatically solving the board.
If we declare the interface to extend <code>Board</code>, it will be a subtype:
</p>
<pre>
interface SolvableBoard extends Board {
    Move[] solve();
}
</pre>
<p>
The definition of <code>SolvableBoard</code> makes it a subtype of
<code>Board</code>: that is, <code>SolvableBoard</code> &lt;: <code>Board</code>,
and  <code>SolvableBoard</code> has all of the methods of <code>Board</code> in
addition to the new <code>solve()</code> method that it adds.
</p>
<p>
The ability to extend interfaces gives even more control over how much of a class is exposed
to client code. Clients that do not need the <code>solve()</code> method can be given the
<code>Board</code> view of the board, avoiding unnecessarily coupling of the implementing
class and its clients. However, the possibility of downcasting means that the abstraction barrier
is more permeable when interfaces are in this way: we get a form of information hiding but not
full encapsulation.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that subtype relationships need to be explicitly declared in
Java. If we declared another separate interface <code>Q</code> that had all the same
methods as <code>Board</code>, plus some additional ones, but did not declare
<code>Q</code> to extend <code>Board</code>, it might appear harmless to
allow <code>Q</code> &lt;: <code>Board</code>. Unlike some languages, Java does not allow
this <b>structural</b> subtype relationships, but only <b>nominal</b>
subtyping, in which subtypes are explicitly declared. There are two reasons for this design:
first, structural subtyping is hard to implement efficiently, and second, just
because two methods have the same name and signature does not mean that they
actually mean the same thing.
</p>
<h2>Conformance</h2>
<p>
For one type to be a subtype of another, the methods of the first type must have signatures
that <b>conform</b> to the signatures of those in the supertype. The conformance requirement
has implications for the types and visibility of methods.
</p>
<p>
For conformance, Java requires that the types of method formal parameters in
the subtype be exactly the same as the types of the corresponding formal
parameters in the supertype. However, the return type of a method in the subtype
may be a subtype of the corresponding return type in the supertype.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the visibility of instance methods in the subclass is not allowed to be
any less than the visibility in the superclass. Visibility modifiers can
be ordered as follows:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<code>private</code> &lt; (package) &lt; <code>protected</code> &lt; <code>public</code>
</div>
<p>
To see why, suppose that a method were declared public in the supertype but was private
in the subtype. If we had a reference to an object of the subtype, the method would
be inaccessible, but would become accessible after an upcast to the supertype.
That private visibility modifier would be misleading and useless, so it is disallowed
in Java. On the other hand, it makes sense and is legal to have a method that
becomes more accessible in the subtype.
</p>


<h3>Behavioral subtyping</h3>
<p>
    Conformance between subtypes and supertypes extends beyond merely
    the signatures of methods. Subtyping should govern the behavior of 
    the subtype as well. If it is safe to use a subtype \(S\) of type \(T\)
    wherever \(T\) is expected, then the specification of the subtype operations
    must <em>also</em> conform to the specification of the \(T\) operations;
    otherwise, client code expecting the behavior specified by \(T\) will be
    unpleasantly surprised by the behavior of \(S\).
</p>
<p>
    In other words, subtyping used correctly is <b>behavioral subtyping</b>; it
    ensures not only that types are compatible but also that <em>behavior</em>
    is.  The principle that objects of a subtype can always be safely
    substituted for supertypes without surprising clients of those supertypes
    is called the <b>Liskov substitution principle</b>, after Barbara Liskov.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the components of the specification, the implication of
    this conformance is that the postcondition of an \(S\) operations must be
    at least as strong as (that is, imply) the postcondition of the
    corresponding \(T\) operation. Conversely, the caller using the \(S\)
    object as if it is a \(T\) would call the operations of the object while
    only satisfying the preconditions specified by \(T\). Therefore, the
    preconditions of \(S\) must be <em>implied by</em> the preconditions of
    \(T\).
</p>

<h2>Factory methods</h2>

<p>
The use of interfaces allows us to write code that is independent of the choice
of implementation—except when the objects are actually created. At some point
an actual implementing class must be provided to <code>new</code>. This might
seem to break the principle of separating interfaces from implementations.
</p> <p>When this stronger separation is desired, a common solution is to use
<b>factory methods</b> to build objects. A factory method is one that creates
objects, typically with an interface type.  For example, we could (in some
class) declare a method that creates <code>Board</code> objects:
</p>
<pre>
static Board createBoard();
</pre>
<p>
This method can be used to create <code>Board</code> objects without committing
to using any particular implementation of the <code>Board</code> interface. A 
factory method need not be static; it may also be a method of some object that
determines which implementation to create.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Java interfaces are a useful mechanism for writing code in which module
clients and module implementations are strongly separated.  In addition, Java's
support for subtyping means that it is possible to write multiple
implementations of the same interface. These different implementations can even
coexist and operate within the same program. This is a valuable feature for
building large software systems.
</p>

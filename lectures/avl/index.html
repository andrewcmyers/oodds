<h1>Balanced binary trees</h1>
<p>
We've already seen that by imposing the <b>binary search tree invariant</b>
(BST invariant), we can search for keys in a tree of height \(h\) in \(O(h)\) time,
assuming that the keys are part of a total order that permits pairwise ordering
tests. However, nothing thus far ensured that \(h\) is not linear in the number of
nodes \(n\) in the tree, whereas we would like to know that trees are <b>balanced</b>:
that their height \(h\), and therefore their worst-case search time, is logarithmic
in the number of nodes in the tree.</p>

<h2>AVL Trees</h2>
<p>
There are many different balanced tree schemes. The first was AVL trees, named
after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. AVL trees strengthen the usual BST
invariant with an additional shape invariant regarding the heights of subtrees. The
<b>AVL invariant</b> states that at each node, the heights of the left
and right subtrees differ by at most one.
</p>
<p>
Let \(h(t)\) be the height of the subtree rooted at node \(t\) (where an empty tree
is considered to have height \(&minus;1\) and a tree consisting of a single node is
considered to have height \(0\)). The <b>balance factor</b> or <b>imbalance</b> of
a node \(t\) is defined to be the difference between the heights of its two subtrees:
<div class=equation>
\[ BF(t) = h(t.\texttt{left}) &minus; h(t.\texttt{right}) \]
</div>

The AVL invariant states that for all nodes \(t\) in the tree, the absolute value
of the balance factor is at most 1:
</p>
<div class=equation>
\[|BF(t)| ≤ 1\]
</div>

All but one of the following trees satisfies the AVL invariant. Which one violates the invariant?

<p class=answer>
The tree that violates the AVL invariant is (c), because its left subtree has height \(1\) and its
right subtree has height \(-1\), so its balance factor is \(2\).
</p>
</div>



<h2>AVL trees are balanced</h2>
<p>
A balanced tree has the property that the height \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\); that is, that \(h
≤ k \log n\) for some \(k\) and sufficiently large \(n\). To demonstrate this fact, we
show that an AVL tree of height \(h\) contains a number of nodes that grows
geometrically with \(h\).
</p>
<p>
Let us determine the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes that must exist in an AVL tree
of height \(h\) or greater; call it \(N(h)\).
A node of height at least \(h\) has two subtrees, one of which must have
height at least \(h&minus;1\). By the AVL invariant, the other subtree must have height at least \(h&minus;2\).
Therefore, the minimum number of nodes that must be in the tree is \(N(h&minus;1)+N(h&minus;2)+1\),
that is, the number of nodes in the two subtrees plus 1 for the root node.
This gives us an equation called a <b>recurrence</b>:
<div class=equation>
\begin{align}
N(h) = 1 + N(h&minus;1) + N(h&minus;2)
\end{align}
</div>
<p class=cont>
From the recurrence and the facts that \(N(&minus;1) = 0\) and \(N(0) = 1\),
we can derive the minimum number of nodes for some small values of \(h\):
</p>

\begin{align}
N(-1) &= 0 \\
N(0)  &= 1 \\
N(1)  &= 2 \\
N(2)  &= 4 \\
N(3)  &= 7 \\
N(4)  &= 12 \\
N(5)  &= 20 \\
     \dots \\
\end{align}

<p>It is not obvious that the function \(N(h)\) grows exponentially, but it does.
Perhaps you noticed that the recurrence for \(N(h)\) closely resembles the famous
<em>Fibonacci recurrence</em>:
\begin{align}
F_n &= F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\
F_0 &= 0 \\
F_1 &= 1
\end{align}

</pre>
</div>
<p>
In fact, if we add 1 to each term in the sequence of values for \(N(h)\), the
familiar Fibonacci sequence emerges: \(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\) . In general,
\(N(h) = F(h+3) - 1\).  We now show that \(N(h)\) grows asymptotically at the same
rate as the Fibonacci sequence and that the Fibonacci sequence grows
exponentially.</p>

<div class=digression>
<h3>Exact formula for the Fibonacci numbers</h3>
<p>
It turns out that the Fibonacci number can be computed with an exact, nonrecursive formula:</p>
\begin{align}
\newcommand\phib{\overline{φ}}
 F_n & = (φ^n &minus; \phib^n)/\sqrt{5} & \text{(1)}
\end{align}
<p>
where \(φ\) is the <b>golden ratio</b> \((1+\sqrt{5})/2 ~~(≈ 1.618)\) and 
\(\phib\) is its negative reciprocal \((1-\sqrt{5})/2 ~~(≈ -0.618)\).
The golden ratio and its negative reciprocal share an interesting property:
\(φ^2 = φ+1\) and \(\phib^2 = \phib+1\). They are both numbers \(x\) such that
\(x^2 = x + 1\), because they are
the two solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\).
Multiplying both sides of the equation on \(φ\) by \(φ^{n-2}\)
and both sides of the equation on \(\phib\) by \(\phib^{n–2}\), we can conclude
that for <em>any</em> exponent n,
</p>
\begin{align}
φ^n & = φ^{n-1} + φ^{n–2} \hspace{6em} & \text{(2)} \\
\phib^n &= \phib^{n–1} + \phib^{n–2}
\end{align}
<p>
Now we can show that the formula (1) for the Fibonacci numbers is correct by induction.
First observe that the formula is correct for n=0 and n=1:</p>

\begin{align}
F_0 & = 0 = (φ^0 - \phib^0)/\sqrt{5} \\
F_1 & = 1 = ((1+\sqrt{5})/2 - (1-\sqrt{5})/2)/\sqrt{5} = (φ^1 - \phib^1)/\sqrt{5}
\end{align}

<p>
Now assume that \(n ≥ 2\) and the formula is correct for the entire sequence up to
but not necessarily including \(F_n\). (This assumption is called the
<em>induction hypothesis</em>). In particular, the formula is assumed correct for \(F_{n-1}\) and \(F_{n-2}\). Then:

\begin{align}
F_n & = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} & \text{(definition of \(F_n\))} \\
    & = (φ^{n-1} - \phib^{n-2})/\sqrt{5} + (φ^{n-2} - \phib^{n–2})/\sqrt{5} & \text{  (by the induction hypothesis)} \\
    & = (φ^{n-1} + φ^{n-2} - (\phib^{n–1} + \phib^{n–2}))/\sqrt{5} &        \text{(by arithmetic)} \\
    & = (φ^n - \phib^n)/\sqrt{5}                       & \text{(by property (2))}
\end{align}
<p>
Since we know the formula (1) works for 0 and 1, and we know that it works for any \(n\) if
it works for \(n-1\) and \(n-2\), we can conclude by
induction that it works for all nonnegative values of \(n\).
</p>
<p>
Observe that since \(|\phib| &lt; 1\), the term \(\phib^n\) becomes
vanishingly small for large \(n\). Asymptotically, the Fibonacci numbers grow as
\(φ^n\). Technically, they are \(\Theta(φ^n)\), meaning that
\(φ^n\) is both an asymptotic upper <em>and lower</em> bound on \(F_n\).
</p>
</div>
<h3>Another inductive argument</h3>
<p>
Without showing an exact formula for \(N(h)\) or \(F_n\), we can even more easily
prove an exponential lower bound on \(N(h)\) by induction. We show that for all
\(h≥0\), the inequality \(N(h) ≥ φ^h\) holds.
Experimentally, we have \(N(0) = 1 = φ^0\) and \(N(1) = 2 ≥ φ^1\). Now assume as an induction hypothesis
that the condition \(N(h) ≥ φ^h\) holds for all values up to but not necessarily including some \(h≥2\).
We can show that the formula must also hold for \(h\),
using the induction hypothesis and property (2).</p>

<p>
Property (2) tells us that \(φ^h = φ^{h-1} + φ^{h-2}\). Then
</p>
\begin{align}
N(h) & = 1 + N(h-1) + N(h-2)           & \text{(by the definition of N)} \\
     & ≥ 1 + φ^{h-1} + φ^{h-2}         & \text{(by the induction hypothesis)} \\
     & ≥ 1 + φ^h                       & \text{(by property (2))} \\
     & ≥ φ^h
\end{align}
<p>
Now we apply induction as before.
The inequality \(N(h) ≥ φ^h\) holds for \(h=0\) and \(h=1\), and we know that for any \(h\), if it
holds for \(h-1\) and \(h-2\) then it holds for \(h\), so we can conclude by
induction that it holds for all \(h≥0\).
</p>
<p>
Since, for all \(h≥0\), we have \(N(h) ≥ φ^h\), we can see that the height of an AVL 
tree is limited. Given an arbitrary AVL
tree of height \(h\) containing \(n\) nodes, we have \(φ^h ≤ N(h) ≤ n\). If
we take the logarithm (base \(φ\)) of this inequality, we obtain
\(h ≤ \log_{φ} n\). All logarithms
are related by constant factors, so \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\).
Therefore, AVL trees are balanced.
</p>

<h2 id=tree_rotations>Tree Rotations</h2>
<p>
The key to balancing search trees is to reorganize them incrementally as
operations are performed, so that they never become unbalanced. However, any
reorganization of the data structure must maintain the BST invariant. The most
important tree transformation is a <b>tree rotation</b>, which swaps a node
with its parent while preserving the BST invariant. If a node \(y\) is the
right child of its parent node \(x\), a <b>left rotation</b> is performed by changing
pointers so that \(y\) becomes the parent of \(x\), turning the data structure on the left into the data structure on the
right.
(Note that \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) here represent entire subtrees that are not affected by the
rotation except that their parent nodes may change.)

<p>
Rotations preserve the BST invariant. Because the BST invariant held before the rotation,
we know that \(A < x < B < y < C\) (where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) stand for all nodes in the
respective subtrees). This ordering of the keys is preserved in the rotated tree.
</p>
<p>
Symmetrically, a <b>right rotation</b> changes the tree on the right side into
the tree on the left, lifting a node \(x\) above its former parent \(y\). And
this transformation keeps the various tree nodes in exactly the same relative order.
</p>
<p>
Tree rotations are efficient because they only affect three nodes of the tree:
the nodes \(x\) and \(y\), and a parent node that is not shown in the diagram above.
In the following code, the variable <code>newChild</code> represents the
appropriate child variable in that parent node.
</p>
<pre>
<b>Left rotation</b>                          <b>Right rotation</b>
x.right = y.left; /* B */              y.left = x.right; /* B */
y.left = p;                            x.right = y;
newChild = y;                          newChild = x;
</pre>

<h2>Inserting into an AVL tree</h2>
<p>
To insert a new element (a key–value pair) into an AVL tree, we start by
using the key in the usual way to find where the key can be inserted as
a leaf while preserving the BST invariant. Adding a new leaf makes the path
to that leaf one longer than previously, so the AVL invariant may now be broken.
The only heights that change are the heights of ancestors of that new leaf, so the AVL invariant can only
broken at nodes along the path from the root to the leaf.
To fix the invariant, we find the lowest node along that path,
and apply one or two tree rotations. Assuming that
the insertion is done recursively, it is easy to identify where along the path
the invariant is broken as the recursive calls return, assuming that each node
keeps track of its height in the tree. Of course, that also means that nodes'
heights must also be updated as the recursion unwinds. It is also possible
to implement insertion iteratively, in this case keeping track of the last
node on the path where the invariant breaks.
</p>
<p>
If inserting a new leaf breaks the AVL invariant at some node \(t\), the invariant
can only be broken by 1; that is, the difference between the heights of the left and right
subtrees of \(t\) is either \(2\) or \(&minus;2\), depending on
whether the insertion happened in the left or right subtree, respectively.
Without loss of generality, let us consider the left-child case, where
the difference is \(2\).
Suppose the right subtree has some height \(h\) and the left subtree
has height \(h+2\).
Since insertion only affected one path, one of the two subtrees
of the left subtree must have height \(h+1\) and the other, \(h\).
Depending on which subtree has height \(h+1\), there are
two cases to consider, which we will call the LL case and the LR case:

In this figure, \(z\) is the lowest node that is unbalanced. Therefore, the
shorter subtree (\(C\) on the left side and \(A\) on the right side) must have height
\(h\); if their heights were smaller, \(z\) would not be the lowest unbalanced node.
</p>
<p>
Now, how do we fix the AVL invariant? If we are in the LL case shown on the
left, we perform a single right rotation to make \(y\) the parent of \(z\), which
updates \(z\) so that its left child is now the former right child of \(y\) (that is, \(C\)).

Balanced subtree after tree rotation(s)
</p>
</div>
<p>
As observed earlier, rotations preserve the BST invariant.
Because the BST invariant held before the rotation, we know
that \(A &lt; x &lt; B &lt; y &lt; C &lt; z &lt; D\) (where \(A, B, C, D\) stand
for all nodes in subtrees \(A, B, C, D\)).
This ordering of the keys is preserved in the rotated tree.</p>

<p>
The rotation reestablishes the AVL invariant.
Since subtrees \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) all have at most height \(h\), the nodes \(x\) and \(z\)
are now at height \(h+1\), and node \(y\) is at height \(h+2\). The longest path within this
part of the tree is now one shorter than before—it's back to \(h+2\)—so
this change also fixes the AVL invariant for all nodes above node \(y\).
</p>
<p>
To fix the AVL invariant in the LR case, we convert the tree into exactly
the same structure as for the LL case. However, this reorganization requires more work:
all three nodes \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) must be changed. This can be described as performing
two rotations, first a left rotation on \(y\) to make it the parent of \(x\), and then a
right rotation on \(y\) to make it the parent of \(z\). An efficient implementation can
take some shortcuts and do the work of both rotations at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Symmetrically to the LL and LR cases, there are RR and RL cases. They are
handled in exactly the same way, yielding the same resulting tree shown
above.

The symmetrical RR and RL cases
</p>
</div>

<h2>An optimization</h2>
<p>
It is not really necessary to store the height of each node at the node.
Instead, we can store just the balance factor of the node: –1, 0, or 1.  Since
there are only three possibilities, only two bits of space are needed at each
node, and the balance factor only needs to be updated when it changes.  For
example, when inserting a node, the only nodes whose balance factor changes are
those on the path from the leaf up to the first unbalanced node (or the root)
and those involved in whatever tree rotations are performed.
</p>

<h2>Deleting from an AVL tree</h2>
<p>
Removing a key from the tree can also make it unbalanced. The algorithm works
in the usual way for BST deletion, depending on the number of children of 
node storing the deleted key. Recall that if that node has 0 children, it
is pruned; if 1 child, it is spliced out, and if 2 children, its element
is replaced with that from the node storing the next (or previous) key in
the tree. The node storing that next or previous key is the node that is
deleted. In any case, deleting a node (whether the node storing the key
or the node storing the next/previous key) may break the AVL invariant
along the path to the deleted node. AVL deletion therefore walks back up
the tree from the deletion point using tree rotations to restore the
AVL invariant.
</p>
<p>
To see how this works, consider the lowest tree node that becomes
unbalanced as the result of deleting a node below it. Without loss
of generality, let's assume that the deleted node is on the right side
of the unbalanced node. Just as for insertion, the cases for deletion
on the other side are symmetrical.
The right child is now at some height \(h\) (formerly \(h+1\)),
and the left side is at height \(h+2\). One of the two grandchildren on the left
side must have height \(h+1\). Let us first consider the case in which the left
grandchild has height \(h+1\) but the right grandchild has only height \(h\).  The tree
then looks as shown in this figure, essentially the same as the LL case for insertion
above:
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=case_LL_del style="width: 200px; height: 180px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("case_LL_del")) {
    setFontSize(14)
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(new RotTree(thisFigure()), "z", ["y", ["x", "A", "B"], "C"], "D")
    align("none", "TB", t.bbox, margin())
    let l1 = measure(point(), point())
    const tv = t.view()
    align("abut", "bottom", l1, hspace(5), tv.findGraphic("A"))
    align("none", "top", l1, tv.findGraphic("x"))
    align("left", "none", l1, margin(4))
    setTextStyle("#06c"); setFontSize(10)
    align("abut", "center", l1, hspace(3), label("h+1"))
    let l2 = measure(point(), tv.findGraphic("C").lr().toRight(5))
    align("none", "top", l2, tv.findGraphic("C"))
    align("abut", "center", l2, hspace(3), label("h"))
    let l3 = measure(point(), tv.findGraphic("D").lr().toRight(5))
    align("none", "top", l3, tv.findGraphic("D"))
    align("abut", "center", l3, hspace(3), label("h"))
    align("right", "none", l3, margin(10))
}
</script>
</div>
<p>
To rebalance the tree, we simply use the same single rotation of \(y\) and \(z\) as in
the LL case above, with the \(y\) node becoming the new root of the subtree.
However, notice that this rotation reduces the height of the subtree from \(h+3\)
to \(h+2\). Therefore, it is necessary to continue walking up toward the root,
potentially fixing other unbalanced nodes along the way.
</p>
<p>
We just assumed that the right grandchild had height \(h\). What if the right grandchild
had height \(h+1\), instead? The picture would then look much like the LR case above:

    let l1 = measure(point(), point())
    const tv = t.view()
    align("abut", "bottom", l1, hspace(5), tv.findGraphic("A"))
    align("none", "top", l1, tv.findGraphic("A"))
    setTextStyle("#06c"); setFontSize(10)
    let lb
    align("abut", "center", lb = label("h or\n h+1"), hspace(3), l1 )
    align("left", "none", lb, margin())
    let l2 = measure(point(), tv.findGraphic("C").lr().toRight(5))
    align("none", "top", l2, tv.findGraphic("y"))
    align("abut", "center", l2, hspace(3), label("h + 1"))
    let l3 = measure(point(), tv.findGraphic("D").lr().toRight(5))
    align("none", "top", l3, tv.findGraphic("D"))
    align("abut", "center", l3, hspace(3), label("h"))
    align("right", "none", l3, margin(10))
}
</script>
</div>
<p>
As in the LR insertion case, we rotate the node \(y\) upward twice to arrive at
the same balanced tree configuration shown above. There is one twist, however.
Depending on the height of the subtree \(A\), the height of the \(y\) node
after the double rotation may be either \(h+2\) or \(h+3\). In other words, the
double rotation may or may not change the height of the whole subtree. It is
only necessary to check whether nodes above \(z\) are still balanced if the double
rotation changes the height of the \(y\) node to \(h+2\).
</p>

<h2>Random Treaps</h2>
<p>
Search trees can be balanced in several other ways. One good one is <b>random
treaps</b>, which are balanced with high probability. Balancing is achieved by
ensuring the tree has exactly the same structure that it would have had if the
elements had been inserted into a binary search tree in a random order.
</p>
<p>
A <b>treap</b> is both a binary search tree and a heap.
Each node contains both a key and a priority. The treap satisfies
the BST invariant with respect to all of its keys, so elements can be found in
the treap in (expected) logarithmic time.  However, the treap is also a <a
href="../lecture.html?id=heaps#Binary%20Heap">heap</a>: it satisfies the heap order invariant with respect to
all its priorities. (It does not, however, satisfy the heap shape invariant, in
general.) Enforcement of the heap order invariant ensures that the tree
structure is exactly what you would get if the elements had been inserted in
priority order into a regular binary search tree.
</p>
<p>For example, the following tree is a treap in which the keys are the letters
and the priorities are the numbers. The BST invariant guarantees traversing the
tree in-order visits the letters alphabetically, while the heap order invariant
ensures that priority increases along any path from a leaf up to the
root.</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=treap_example style="width: 180px; height: 120px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("treap_example")) {
    setFontSize(16)
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(lightStyle(), "E, 1", ["B, 3", "A, 7", "C, 8"], ["F, 4", undefined, "G, 9"])
    align("LR", "TB", t.bbox, margin())
}
</script>
</div>
<p>
Elements are added to the treap in the usual way for binary search trees. However,
this may break the heap invariant on priorities. To fix the heap invariant, the element
is bubbled up through the treap. However, to bubble up an element, tree rotations are used
instead of simply swapping the element with its parent. Tree rotations are needed in order
to ensure that bubbling does not break the BST invariant.
</p>
<p>
For example, adding a node D with priority 2 to the treap above results in the following
rotations being done to restore the heap invariant.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=treap_add style="width: 540px; height: 150px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("treap_add")) {
    setFontSize(16)
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    function transform(t1, t2) {
        return arrow(t1.bbox, t2.bbox)
            .setLineWidth(10).setArrowSize(25).setStrokeStyle("#d66").setFillStyle("#d66")
    }
    const u = undefined
    const t1 = tree(lightStyle(), "E,1", ["B,3", "A,7", ["C,8", u, "D,2"]], ["F,4", u, "G,9"])
    const t2 = tree(lightStyle(null, ["D,2", "C,8"]), "E,1", ["B,3", "A,7", ["D,2", "C,8", u]], ["F,4", u, "G,9"])
    const t3 = tree(lightStyle(null, ["D,2", "C,8", "B,3"]), "E,1", ["D,2", ["B,3", "A,7", "C,8"], u], ["F,4", u, "G,9"])
    equal(t1.bbox.w(), t2.bbox.w(), t3.bbox.w())
    transform(t1, t2)
    transform(t2, t3)
    align("LR", "TB",
        group(t1.bbox, hspace(50),
              t2.bbox, hspace(50),
              t3.bbox)
        .align("abut", "TB"), margin())
}
</script>
</div>
<p>
This is exactly the tree structure we would have gotten if we had inserted all the nodes
into a simple BST in the order specified by their priorities.
</p>
<p>
Finally, to obtain a tree that is balanced with high probability, we simply assign random
priorities to elements as they are inserted. The resulting tree will then have the same
structure as a binary search tree whose elements were inserted in random order, which
we know has height \(O(\lg n)\) with high probability.
</p>

<h2>Other balanced binary trees</h2>
<p>
Other balanced binary search trees (and more generally, n-ary search trees)
also strengthen the search tree invariant to ensure that the tree remains
balanced. Of the many balanced search tree data structures, here are some of the
most important:
<ul>
<li>Red–black trees
<ul>
<li>Nodes are colored red or black.
<li>The number of black nodes on every path from the root to a leaf is the same for every leaf: the <b>black height</b> of the tree.
<li>There are no red–red edges.
<li>The shortest path length is \(h/2\), so the tree contains at least \(n ≥ 2^{h/2}\) nodes. Therefore, \(h ≤ 2 \lg n = O(\log n) \) : the tree is balanced.
</ul>
<li>2–3–4 trees
<ul>
<li>Every leaf has the same depth.
<li>Every node has 2, 3, or 4 children, except the leaves, so the tree height
 is \(O(\log n)\) in the number of elements \(n\).
<li>2–3–4 trees are isomorphic to red–black trees, with each node in a 2–3–4 tree corresponding
to 1, 2, or 3 nodes in the corresponding red–black tree.
</ul>
<li>B-trees
<ul>
<li>An \(N\)-ary generalization of 2–3–4 trees.
<li>Every leaf has the same depth.
<li>Every node except the root has at least \(\lceil N/2\rceil\) children, which ensures the tree height
 is \(O(\log n)\) in the number of elements \(n\). Taking \(N\) into account,
 the height is \(O(\log n)/O(\log N)\).
<li>If \(N\) is large, relatively few edges are followed to reach any given leaf.
<li>However, B-trees are characterized by complex logic with tricky corner cases.
<li>They are used frequently in databases and file systems where indirections are especially expensive.
</ul>
<li>Splay trees
<ul>
<li>A splay tree is a binary search tree with, surprisingly, <em>no</em> additional shape invariant.
<li>Searching in the tree causes tree rotations that incrementally rebalance the tree.
<li>Searched-for nodes are also rotated to top of tree, so repeatedly
    searching for the same elements is especially fast.
<li>Asymptotically optimal (amortized) performance: \(O(\log n)\).
<li>Used in network routers to figure out where to send packets.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these data structures (except splay trees) imposes an additional invariant that
ensures the tree remains balanced. For example, red–black trees have a
<b>color invariant</b>: every node is either red or black, and on every path
from the root to a leaf, there are the same number of black nodes but no
adjacent red nodes. B-trees and 2–3–4 trees are perfectly balanced n-ary search
trees in which the number of children varies between \(&lceil;n/2&rceil;\) and \(n\)
(except that the root may have as few as 2 children).
</p>
<p>
Note that search trees with a branching factor of \(b\) must store at least \(b&minus;1\) keys
at each node in order to know which child to go to when searching. For example,
in a 2–3–4 tree, there can be up to 3 keys at a given node.
</p>

<h1>Loop invariants</h1>
<p>
Writing correct loops can be a challenging part of programming. To make it
manageable to be able to convince ourselves that our code is correct, we want
to use <strong>local reasoning</strong>, in which we consider one small piece
of code at a time. Loops make reasoning challenging because they can
do a lot of complex work.  To obtain local reasoning for loops, we want to
be able to reason about loops one iteration at a time.
</p>
<p>
We have already seen a related challenge for local reasoning that gives
some insight about how to solve the problem of reasoning about loops. When writing the code
for a method, we are allowed to assume that the method's precondition is
true, and it is our job as implementers to write code that makes the method's
postcondition true. But <em>in addition</em>, we are allowed to rely on
a class invariant. Of course, also we have an obligation to ensure that at the
end, the class invariant is still true. We can visualize this
reasoning process in the following diagram:
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=method_reasoning style="width:400px; height: 200px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("method_reasoning")) {
    let code = rectangle().setH(40).setW(80).addText("method\nbody")
    let pre = label("precondition"), post = label("postcondition")
    let c = margin(2)
    let t1 = point(), t2 = point(), b1 = point(), b2 = point()
    equal(t1, average(code.ul(), code.uc()))
    equal(t2, average(code.ur(), code.uc()))
    equal(b1, average(code.ll(), code.lc()))
    equal(b2, average(code.lr(), code.lc()))
    align("center", "distribute", pre, average(t1, b1), post)
    align("none", "top", pre, c)
    align("none", "bottom", post, c)
    arrow(pre, t1)
    arrow(b1, post)
    let v  = 60, w = 100
    connector(b2, b2.toBottom(v), code.lr().toRight(w).toBottom(v), code.ur().toRight(w).toTop(v), t2.toTop(v), t2)
      .setEndArrow("arrow")
    align("left", "top", label("class invariant"), b2.toRight(8).toBottom(5))
    align("left", "bottom", label("class invariant"), t2.toRight(8).toTop(5))
}
</script>
<p>
What this diagram suggests is that code transforms facts about the state of the running
program. Method code is correct if, starting from a state in which both the precondition and
the class invariant are true, it ends in a state where the postcondition and the class
invariant are both true.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when we want to convince ourselves that our code is correct, we need
to be able to argue that certain things are true at various points in the
program, and that the code we are writing transforms those facts in the right
way.  Loops pose a special challenge for such arguments, because the same code
can be executed multiple times. How do we know what is true about the program
as loops execute?
</p>
<p>
A <b>loop invariant</b> is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of
every iteration of a loop, somewhat like a class invariant,
which must be true at the beginning and end of every public method. When you
write a loop that works correctly, you are at least implicitly relying on a
loop invariant.  Knowing what a loop invariant is and thinking explicitly about
loop invariants will help you write correct, efficient code, especially when implementing
tricky algorithms.
</p>
<h2>Binary search via iteration</h2>
<p>
Some loops are hard to write correctly without thinking about loop invariants.
For example, suppose we want to find an element in a sorted array. We can do
much better than scanning from left to right, which would take linear time: as
we saw earlier, <b>binary search</b> can find an element in logarithmic time.
We can use loop invariants to take a more careful look at this algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The core of binary search can be expressed as a loop:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="binary_search.java">binary_search.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Conceptually, the algorithm is simple and makes intuitive sense:
the algorithm keeps cutting the part of the array where it is
looking for <code>x</code> in half.  But it is surprisingly tricky to get this
code exactly right if you have to write it yourself, because there are multiple
opportunities to make mistakes. How do we know we got the
computation of <code>m</code> right?  Why is it <tt>x &lt;= a[m]</tt> and not
<tt>x &lt; a[m]</tt>? Why <code>m</code> and <code>m+1</code> in the two
updates to <code>r</code> and <code>l</code> respectively? If we change any of
these decisions, the algorithm is incorrect and will sometimes fail to find the
correct element.
</p>
<p>
The key question is whether the code of the loop is correct. We have discussed
preconditions and postconditions of methods, but to say what it
means for the loop to be correct, we must identify the precondition and the postcondition
of the loop itself. Its precondition describes the possible states of the
program just as the loop begins executing; its postcondition describes the
desired states when the loop stops. In this case, the precondition consists
of the precondition of <code>search()</code> itself, plus the facts established
by the first line of code:
<code>l = 0</code> and <code>r = a.length - 1</code>. The desired
postcondition of the loop is that <code>x = a[l]</code>. To show that the loop
is correct, we use a loop invariant to convince ourselves that the loop
transforms the state of the running program from one satisfying the
precondition to one satisfying the postcondition.
</p>
<h2>Binary search loop invariant</h2>
<p>
A <b>loop invariant</b> describes the conditions that the loop body must
preserve in order to be correct. For this example, such a loop
invariant can be expressed using three clauses:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The array <code>a</code> is sorted in ascending order.
<li> <code>0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ a.length-1</code></li>
<li> <code>x ∈ a[l..r]</code></li>
</ol>
<p>
We use the notation <code>i..j</code> to denote the set or sequence <code>{x |
i ≤ x ≤ j}</code> or <code>(i,i+1,...,j-1,j)</code>. We use the notation
<code>a[i..j]</code> to denote the subsequence of the array <code>a</code>
starting from <code>a[i]</code> and continuing up to and including
<code>a[j]</code>.
</p>
<p>
If we squint at this loop invariant, we can see that it looks a bit like
the precondition and a bit like the postcondition, but generalizes both
of them. The invariant looks like the precondition except that it
ranges over just the indices from <code>l</code> to <code>r</code>.
And the third part of the invariant looks like the postcondition,
except that it talks about a range of the array rather than a single
element. The loop invariant captures the progress that the algorithm
makes as it runs.
</p>
<p>
The loop invariant is not actually exactly the same on every loop iteration,
because it depends on the state of the program, such as the values of the
mutable variables <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> in the example. The loop
invariant is a <b>predicate</b>—a logical formula—over the program state.
</p>
<p>
If we know what the loop invariant is for a loop, and it is not blindingly
obvious to the reader, it is often a good idea to document it. Further, we can
document the loop invariant in a <em>checkable</em> way by including an <code>assert</code>
statement to be executed on every loop iteration.
</p>

<h2>Loop invariants and tail-recursive functions</h2>
<p>
We observed earlier that tail-recursive functions can be converted into
loops. Conversely, loops can be converted into tail-recursive functions.
What is the relationship of this tail-recursive function to the loop
invariant?
</p>
<p>
For example, the loop in the binary search algorithm can be converted to
a tail-recursive function <code>search_rec</code>:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="binary_search_recursive.java">binary_search.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the precondition of the tail-recursive function
<code>search_rec</code> is exactly the loop invariant!
Further, the postcondition of the loop is just the postcondition of the function.
This correspondence is no accident: a loop
invariant is simply the precondition of the corresponding tail-recursive
function.  The loop preserves the loop invariant <em>exactly</em> when the precondition
is satisfied for any tail-recursive calls it makes.
</p>
<p>
Often it can help us to identify the loop invariant
if we think of a loop as a function whose precondition must be satisfied and
whose postcondition must ensure the loop's postcondition is satisfied. If
the loop invariant is not a strong enough precondition to ensure that the
tail-recursive function works correctly, then something is missing from it.
</p>
<h2>Using loop invariants to show code is correct</h2>
<p>
Loop invariants can help us convince ourselves that our code,
especially tricky code, is correct. They also help us develop code
that is correct in the first place, and they help us write efficient code.

</script>
<p>
To use a loop invariant to argue that code does what we want, we
use the following steps, depicted in the figure:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Establishment (aka Initialization).</b> Show that the loop invariant is
true just after loop initialization. That is, the loop invariant must be
implied by the loop precondition.
For while-loops of the form <code>while
(<i>guard</i>) { <i>body</i> }</code>, the invariant must be true before
beginning the loop.  For for-loops <code>for (<i>init</i>; <i>guard</i>;
<i>incr</i>) { body }</code>, the invariant must be true just after executing
the code <code><i>init</i></code>, which is not properly part of the loop because
it is executed only once.</p>
<p>
Viewing the loop as a tail-recursive function, Establishment is about showing that
the function's precondition holds when it is first called.
</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Postcondition.</b> Show that if the <code>guard</code> is false (so the loop exits)
and the loop invariant holds, then the desired result of the loop
has been achieved: the loop postcondition holds.
</p>
<p>
Viewing the loop as a tail-recursive function, Postcondition is about showing that
the function's postcondition holds in the base case.
</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Preservation (aka Maintenance).</b> Show that whenever both the loop invariant and the
<code>guard</code> are true just before executing the loop body, then the loop
invariant is true just <em>after</em> executing the loop body. Note that the
loop invariant may fail to be true at intermediate steps during the execution
of the loop body, as long as it is reestablished by the end.  (For
<code>for</code> loops, the loop body also includes the increment
<code>incr</code>.)
</p>
<p>
Viewing the loop as a tail-recursive function, Preservation is about showing
that the function's precondition holds when it calls itself tail-recursively.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>Other than coming up with the loop invariant in the first place, the Preservation
step is typically the most challenging. The Postcondition step is a crucial step too.
If the chosen loop invariant is too weak, this step will not be possible. Defining a
too-weak invariant is a common mistake, so it is good to try the Postcondition step early.</p>

<p>
These three steps allow us to conclude that the loop satisfies
<b>partial correctness</b>, which means that if the loop terminates, it
will succeed. To show <b>total correctness</b>, we must show in addition
that the loop eventually terminates. To show this, there is a fourth step:
</p>
<ol>
<li value="4"><b>Termination.</b> Assuming the loop invariant holds at the start of
each iteration, show that some quantity strictly decreases, and that it cannot
decrease indefinitely.
This quantity is called the <b>decrementing function</b>, <b>decreasing function</b>, or 
<b>loop variant</b>, and it is a function of the program state: that is, the variables
appearing in the loop. Call the decrementing function DF,
we need to show that if the loop guard is true, then the value of DF after
the loop body (call it DF') is strictly less than it was at the beginning: DF' &lt; DF.
Further, there must be some minimal value DF<sub>0</sub> such that if DF &lt; DF<sub>0</sub>,
then either the loop guard or the loop invariant is false. That is, the result of DF must
be an element of a well-founded set in which it is not possible to decrease forever.
Since <em>every</em> interation decreases DF, it will eventually reach a point where it cannot
decrease, so the loop cannot run forver.
</li>
<p>
Viewing the loop as a tail-recursive function, Termination is about showing
that the arguments to the function decrease in its tail-recursive call or calls.
</p>
</ol>

<p>
Let's try these four steps on the binary search algorithm.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Establishment.</b>
  <p>The loop invariant has three clauses; we can argue that each one holds:
  <ol>
<li>That array <code>a</code> is sorted is in the precondition of <code>search</code>.

<li>Since <code>a.length</code> is at least 1 by the precondition that <code>x</code> is in the array, and since initially <code>l = 0</code> and <code>r = a.length-1</code>, we have <code>0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ a.length-1</code>.</li>
<li> <code>x ∈ a[l..r]</code> because that is the whole array and the precondition
       guarantees that <code>x</code> is there.</li>
  </ol></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Postcondition.</b> <p>For the algorithm to be correct, we need
  <code>a[l] = x</code>. If the loop guard is false, we know <code>l ≥
  r</code>. But the invariant (2) guarantees <code>l ≤ r</code>, so we must
  have <code>l = r</code>. We know from the invariant (3) that <code>x ∈
  a[l..r]</code>, which has been reduced to a single element, so that must be
  where <code>x</code> is.</p></li>

  <li><b>Preservation.</b>
  <p>Since the loop doesn't change the array, clearly the first clause of the invariant
   is preserved. Arguing the remaining clauses is a bit trickier.</p>
  <p>We use <code>l'</code> and <code>r'</code> to represent the values of <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> at the end of the loop.
  We want to show that if the invariant is true at the beginning of the loop body,
  that is, if <code>0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ a.length-1</code> and <code>x ∈ a[l..r]</code>,
  then clauses 2 and 3 are true at the end of the loop body, that is,
  <code>0 ≤ l' ≤ r' ≤ a.length-1</code> and <code>x ∈ a[l'..r']</code>.</p>

  <p>
  Note that <code>m</code> is the average of <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>, rounded down. So we
  know that <code>l ≤ m ≤ r</code>. In fact, because  the loop guard <code>l &lt; r</code> is true
  and the value of <code>m</code> is rounded down, we know something stronger: <code>l ≤ m &lt; r</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  How the loop body executes depends on the outcome of the test <code>x &lt;= a[m]</code>. There
  are two cases to consider: either <code>x &lt;= a[m]</code> or <code>x &gt; a[m]</code>.
  We analyze the two cases separately.
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li><p><b>Case</b> <code>x &lt;= a[m]</code>:</p>
	<p>
          In this case we have <code>l' = l</code> and <code>r' = m</code>.
          Since we have <code>0 ≤ l ≤ m < r ≤ a.length-1</code> as just argued,
          clause 2 is preserved: <code>0 ≤ l' ≤ r' ≤ a.length-1</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          How about clause 3? By the loop invariant, we know that <code>k</code> occurs at
          least once in <code>a[l..r]</code>. Since <code>x &lt;= a[m]</code>,
          it must occur at or before index <code>m</code>. Therefore we have
          <code>x∈a[l..m] = a[l'..r']</code>, as required.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>Case</b> <code>x &gt; a[m]</code>:</p>
	<p>
          Clause 2. In this case, the loop body sets <code>r' = r</code> and <code>l' = m+1</code>. We know <code>m &lt; r</code>, so <code>l' = m + 1 ≤ r = r'</code>.
          Therefore, we have <code>0 ≤ l' ≤ r' ≤ a.length-1</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
          Clause 3.  Since the array is sorted, <code>x</code> cannot be
          located in <code>a[l..m]</code>. But according to the invariant, it
          is in <code>a[l..r]</code>. Therefore, <code>x</code> is in
          <code>a[m+1..r]</code> = <code>a[l'..r']</code>,
          as required.
	  </p>
	</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Termination.</b>
  <p>The value DF = <code>r &minus; l</code> is guaranteed by the invariant
  (1) to be nonnegative: we can choose DF<sub>0</sub> = 0.
  In the case where <code>x ∈ a[l..m]</code>, we know <code>m &lt; r</code>, so
  <code>r' &minus; l' &lt; r &minus; l</code>. In the other case, we know <code>l &lt; m+1</code>, so again,
  <code>r' &minus; l' &lt; r &minus; l</code>. Thus the quantity <code>r &minus; l</code> gets strictly
  smaller on every loop iteration as long as <code>l &lt; r</code>. Therefore,
  the loop eventually terminates.
</ol>

<p>
In this case, the loop invariant has three clauses, but it is tempting to leave things out of the
loop invariant. If clauses are omitted, the invariant may be too weak:
Establishment is easier to argue, but it becomes impossible to show
Preservation or Postcondition. On the other hand, if the loop invariant is too
strong because it contains clauses that shouldn't be there, then
Establishment or Preservation become impossible to show.
</p>
<p>
Let's consider what would have happened had we omitted any of the three clauses from
the binary search loop invariant:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If we didn't know the array was sorted, our reasoning about where the element <code>x</code> was
would fail.
</li>
<li><p><code>l ≤ r</code><br>
Without this clause, we don't know that we are going to the correct side when we split
on <code>m</code>. The Termination argument also fails because the decrementing
function is no longer guaranteed to be nonnegative.
</p>
<li><p><code>x ∈ a[l..r]</code><br>
Without this clause, we don't know that the loop has found anything when it terminates,
so Postcondition fails.
</p>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Example: Exponentiation by squaring and multiplication</h2>
<p>
Here is a second example of using a loop invariant to show that an inobvious algorithm works correctly.
It is a fairly efficient implementation of exponentiation.
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="Pow.java">Pow.java</a>
</pre>

<p>Intuitively, this algorithm converts the exponent \(e\) into
a binary (base-2) representation. We can think of a number in base 2 as a sum of powers of 2. So
\( e = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + ... \) and \(x^e = x^{2^{k_1}+2^{k_2}+···} \)
(Note that \(x^{2^k}\) always means \(x^{(2^k)}\), never \((x^2)^k\).)</p>

<p>
For example, if \(e = 11010\) in binary, then \(x^e = x^{11010} = x^{10000+1000+10} = x^{10000}·x^{1000}·x^{10}\).
</p>

<p>
By repeatedly halving \(y\) and inspecting the resulting parity,
the algorithm finds each of the &ldquo;1 digits&rdquo; in the binary
representation of \(e\), corresponding to the terms \(2^{k_i} \),
and for such a digit at position \(k\), multiplies into \(r\) the appropriate factor,
\(x^{2^k}\). That is the intuition, but the loop invariant will help convince us
that it really does work. The loop invariant captures that part of the final
result has been transferred into \(r\) and that what remains to be multiplied into the result
is \(b^y\). As we can see in the code, the loop invariant is:
<ol><li> \( x^e = r·b^y \)
    <li> \( y ≥ 0 \)
</ol>

</p>

<p>Let's consider the four steps outlined above.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Establishment.</b> <p>Initially, \(r=1\), \(b=x\) and \(y=e\),
so trivially we have \(r·b^y = x^e\). Also, we know \(y &ge; 0\) since initially \(y = e\), and
\(e &ge; 0\) is a precondition of the loop.</p></li>

<li><b>Postcondition.</b>
<p>If the loop guard is false, then \(y = 0\), since \(y &ge; 0\) and not \(y &gt; 0\).
But if \(y = 0\), then \(r = r·b^y = x^e\), and that is the desired return value.</p></li>

<li><b>Preservation.</b> <p>Let us use \(y'\), \(b'\), and \(r'\) to refer to the values of these variables
at the end of the loop body.
We need to show that if \(y &gt; 0\) and \(x^e = r·b^y\) at the beginning of
the loop body, then \(y'≥0\) and \(x^e = r'·b'^{y'}\) at the end
of the loop body. It suffices to show that if the loop guard \(y &gt; 0\) holds, then
\(r'·b'^{y'} = r·b^y\) and \(y'≥0\). There are two cases to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Case: y is even</b>. In this case, \(r' = r\), \(y' = y/2\), and \(b'= b^2\).
Therefore, \(r'·b'^{y'} = r·(b^2)^{(y/2)} = r·b^y\), as desired.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Case: y is odd</b>. Here we have \(r'=r·b\), \(y' = (y-1)/2\), and \(b' = b^2\).
Therefore, \(r'·b'^{y'} = r·b·(b^2)^{(y-1)/2} 
          = r·b·b^{(y-1)}
          = r·b^y\), again.</p></li>
<p>In either case, the other part of the invariant, \(y' &ge; 0\), holds
since halving a positive number cannot make it negative.</p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Termination.</b>
<p>Dividing by two makes the quantity \(y\) strictly smaller on every loop iteration,
because it is always positive when the guard is true.
When the value of \(y\) is 0, the loop guard is false, so
the loop must eventually terminate.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Therefore, the loop terminates <em>and</em> returns the correct value of \(x^e\).
</p>

<h2>Debugging and choosing loop invariants</h2>
<p>
Finding the loop invariant can be tricky, because it needs to precisely crystallize
the reason why the loop works. The loop invariant needs to be weak enough that it
permits all possible states the program can get into during the loop. But it also needs
to be strong enough that the loop postcondition is satisfied when the loop exits.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, two things commonly go wrong when choosing a loop invariant.
The most typical error is to define a loop invariant that is too weak. This
error is usually detected when trying to take the Postcondition step. All we
know when arguing the Postcondition step is that the loop invariant holds and
the guard does not. If the loop invariant is too weak, we can't argue that from
those two facts that the loop achieves its postcondition. In essence, the
loop invariant has forgotten too much about what past loop iterations accomplished.
A too-weak invariant may also be detected in the
Preservation step, when the weak loop invariant does not restrict the
state enough to show that even it is preserved by the loop.
</p>
<p>
The other common error is to define a loop invariant that is too strong. This
mistake can happen when we try to define invariant that is strong enough to
prove Postcondition, but don't leave room for the rest of the loop to finish
its job. This error typically shows up when one tries to prove Preservation,
because the overly strong loop invariant simply isn't preserved by executing the loop
body. This error might also show up in the Establishment step,
if the putative loop invariant doesn't even hold at the start of the loop.
</p>
<p>
Choosing loop invariants is a bit of an art, but becomes easier with practice.
The key is that a loop invariant really does capture the core reason why the
loop works. So imagine trying to explain to someone why the loop works, and
write down conditions that capture the essence of that explanation. Thinking
about the loop invariant as the precondition of a tail-recursive function may
also help.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the loop invariant must be implied by the loop precondition and it
must imply the loop postcondition; in a sense, the loop invariant
interpolates between the precondition and postcondition.
It can be helpful to write down both the precondition and the postcondition
together, and then to try to come up with a logical statement that captures
both of them. It should generalize both the precondition and the postcondition,
but be close to the precondition as the loop starts and close to the
postcondition when it ends. For example, in the binary search algorithm,
we want <code>k = a[l]</code> at the end and we have <code>k ∈ a[0..a.length-1]</code>
at the beginning.  The loop-invariant statement <code>k ∈ a[l..r]</code>
generalizes both of these assertions.

<h2>Loop invariants in software engineering</h2>
<p>
Loop invariants capture key facts that explain why code works.
If you write code in which the loop invariant is not obvious, you should
add a comment that gives the loop invariant. This helps other programmers
understand the code, and helps keep them (and you!) from accidentally breaking
the invariant with future changes.
</p>
<p>
Just as it makes sense to add assertions to check function preconditions,
it also makes sense to add assertions that check for each iteration 
the parts of the loop invariant that are easy to check. Such assertions will catch errors
early and expose problems with your understanding of why the code works.

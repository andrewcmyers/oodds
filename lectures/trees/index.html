<h1>Trees</h1>
<p>
Trees are a very useful class of data structures. Like (singly) linked lists, trees
are <b>acyclic</b> graphs of node objects in which each node may have some
attached information. Whereas linked list nodes have zero or one successor
nodes, tree nodes may have more.
Having multiple successor nodes (called
<b>children</b>) makes trees more versatile as a way to represent information
and often more efficient as a way to find information within the data
structure.
</p>
<p>
Like lists, trees are recursive data structures. A non-empty tree has a single <b>root node</b> that
is the starting point for searching in the tree. All nodes in the tree are
reachable from the root by following a path of edges.
All nodes except the root have exactly one predecessor node, called its
<b>parent</b>. The root is the only node with no parent.</p>

<p>It is customary to draw trees growing downward. The root
node may be indicated by an incoming edge.

<p>
Because a tree is a recursive data structure, each node in the tree is
the root of a <b>subtree</b>. For example, in the following tree, the node G has
two children B and H, each of which is the root of a subtree. This tree is
a <b>binary tree</b> in which each node has up to two children, which are
implicitly distinguished as its left and right children. We say that
a binary tree has a <b>branching factor</b> of 2. The children of a node are usually
ordered from left to right, so B is the left child of G and root of the left
subtree of G, and H is the right child of G and root of the right subtree of G.
A node with no children is called a <b>leaf</b>.

<p>
Each node in a tree has a <b>height</b> and a <b>depth</b>. The <b>depth</b> of
a node is the length of the (unique) path from the root down to that node. The
length of a path is the number of edges in the path, so the depth of the root
is always 0.  The <b>height</b> of a node is the length of the longest path
from that node to a leaf below it, so leaf nodes have height 0. The height of
the tree is the height of its root, which is the same as the depth of its
deepest leaf. Therefore, a tree consisting of a single (root) node has height
0. It is also possible to have an empty tree, with no nodes or edges; we will
consider such a tree to have height &minus;1. (It is possible, though less
standard, to define the height of a tree as the number of <em>nodes</em> along
the longest path to a leaf, so that an empty tree has height 0; for reasoning
about asymptotic complexity, it almost never matters which definition is used.)
</p>
<p>
We can represent a binary tree using a class with instance variables for
the left and right children:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="BinaryNode.java">BinaryNode</a>
</pre>
<p>For trees with a larger branching factor, the children can be stored in another
data structure such as an array or linked list:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="NAry.java">NAry</a>
</pre>
<p>
Analogously to doubly linked lists, tree nodes in some tree data structures
maintain a pointer to their parent node. A parent pointer can be
useful for walking upward in a tree, though it takes up extra memory and
creates additional maintenance requirements.
</p>
<h2>Why trees?</h2>
<p>Tree data structures are important for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some information has a natural tree-like structure, so storing it
in trees makes sense. Examples of such information include parse trees of expressions,
inheritance and subtyping hierarchies, game search trees, and decision trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Trees make
it possible to find information within the data structure relatively quickly,
when they can be arranged that all nodes are fairly close to the root. For simplicity, let's
think about a <b>complete binary tree of height \(h\)</b> in which all leaves are at equal depth \(h\) and all non-leaves have exactly two children. In a complete binary tree of depth \(h ≥ 0\), there are \(1 + 2
+ 4 + ･･･ + 2^h = 2^{h+1} &minus; 1\) nodes. Calling this number
of nodes \(n\), we have \(h = \lg(n+1)-1\), so \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\). (Recall that \(\lg x\) is the
base-2 logarithm of \(x\), and that \(O(\log_a n) = O(\log_b n)\) for any constant
bases \(a\) and \(b\).) Thus, if we are looking for information in a complete binary
tree, it can be reached along a path whose length is logarithmic in the total
information stored in the tree.
</p>
<p>For large \(n\), logarithmic time is a big speedup over the linear-time
performance offered by data structures like linked lists and arrays. For example,
\(\lg 1,\!000,\!000\) is approximately 20, a speedup of around 50,000 (ignoring constant
factors), and
\(\lg 1,\!000,\!000,\!000\) is about
30, a speedup of more than 30,000,000.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Binary search trees</h2>
<p>
Efficiently searching for information in trees relies on knowing which path to take through the
tree. This property can be obtained if  the data stored in tree nodes can be ordered
according to some ordering relation. For example, we might search for information by using
a string value as the key, and order the strings by dictionary order.
</p>
<p>
Given ordered data, the tree as a <b>search tree</b>. A particularly important form
of search tree is a <b>binary search tree</b>, which is a binary tree that
satisfies the following data structure invariant:</p>

<p class=definition>
Binary Tree Order Invariant:
For each node \(n\) in the tree, all data elements stored in \(n\)'s left subtree
are less than the element stored at \(n\), and all elements stored in \(n\)'s right
subtree are greater than the element stored at \(n\).
</p>

<p>We can visualize the tree relative to a given node as in this picture. Note that we've stopped
drawing arrowheads on the tree edges, relying instead on the convention that edges go downward:

    equal(margin().y0(), t.y0())
    equal(plus(45, t.y1()), margin().y1())
}
</script>
</div>
<p>
We can express this data structure invariant as a class invariant:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="BST.java">BST</a>
</pre>
<p class="cont">
Since the invariant is defined on a recursive type, it applies recursively
throughout the tree, ensuring that data structure invariant holds for every node.</p>
<p>
For the invariant to make sense, we must be able to
compare two elements to see which is greater (in some ordering).
One way to provide such an ordering is to require the parameter
type <code>T</code> to extend the interface <code>Comparable<T></code>:
<pre class=load>
<a href="comparable.java">BST</a>
</pre>
Here, the ordering is specified by the operation <code>compareTo()</code>. To
ensure that the type <code>T</code> has such an operation, we specify
in the class declaration that <code>T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>,
where <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> is the generic interface shown above.
The keyword <code>extends</code> signifies that <code>T</code>
is a <em>subtype</em> of <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>. Thus
<code>T</code> can be a class that implements the interface.
The compiler will prevent us from instantiating the class <code>BinaryNode</code>
on any type T that is not a declared subtype of <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>,
therefore the code of <code>BinaryNode</code> can assume that <code>T</code>
has the <code>compareTo()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
A more flexible way to define the ordering is to provide it through a
<b>comparator object</b> that implements the Comparator interface:
<pre class=load>
<a href="Comparator.java">BST</a>
</pre>
<p>
The comparator approach, which is is an example of the Concept design pattern,
has slightly higher storage requirements since the
comparator must be remembered, but its advantage is that it allows the binary
search tree to be used with <em>any</em> type for which a reasonable comparison
operation can be defined, and not just with those types <code>T</code> that happen to declare that
they extend <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>.  This looser coupling can be helpful when
you don't have control over the class that you would like to put into a tree, or when
that class defines a notion of comparison that doesn't match the one you want.
</p>

<h3>Searching in a binary search tree</h3>
<p>
Consider what happens when we try to find a path down through the tree looking for an
arbitrary element x. We compare x to the root data value. If x is equal to the data value,
then we've already found it. If x is less than the data value and it's in the tree, it
<em>must</em> be in the left subtree, so we can walk down to the left subtree and look for
the element there. Conversely, if x is greater than the data value and it's in the tree, it
must by in the right subtree, so we should look for it there. In either case,
if the subtree where x must be is empty (null), the element must not be in the tree. This
algorithm can be expressed compactly as a (tail-)recursive method on <code>BinaryNode</code>:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="contains.java">BST</a>
</pre>
<p>
We've used Java's &ldquo;ternary expression&rdquo; here to make the code
more compact (and to show off another coding idiom!) The expression
<code><i>b</i> ? <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>e</i><sub>2</sub></code> is a
<b>conditional expression</b> whose value is the result of either
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub> or <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>, depending on whether the boolean
expression <i>b</i> evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>
Since the method is tail-recursive, we can also write it as a loop. Here is a
version where the root of the tree is passed in explicitly as a parameter
<code>n</code>:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="contains-loop.java">contains-loop</a>
</pre>
<h3>Adding an element to a binary search tree</h3>
<p>
To add an element so we can find it later, it has to be added along
the search path that will be used. To add an element, we first search for it.
If found, it need not be added; if not found,
it is added as a child of the leaf node reached along the search path.
Again, this can be written easily as a tail-recursive method:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="add.java">add</a>
</pre>
<p>
To see how this algorithm works, consider adding the element 3 to the tree
shown with the black edges in the following diagram. We start at the root (2)
and go to the right (5) because 3 &gt; 2. In the recursive call we then go to
the left (3 &lt; 5) to node 4. Since 3 &lt; 4, we try to go to the left but
observe <code>left == null</code>, and therefore create a left child containing 3,
shown by the gray edge.

<h3>Asymptotic performance of binary search trees</h3>
<p>
The time required to search for elements in a search tree is in the worst case
proportional to the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf, or the
height of the tree, \(h\). Therefore, tree operations take \(O(h)\) time.
</p>
<p>
With the simple binary search tree implementation we've seen so far,
the worst performance is seen when elements are inserted in order, e.g.:
<code>add(1)</code>, <code>add(2)</code>, <code>add(3)</code>, ..., <code>add(n)</code>. The resulting binary tree
has only right children and has the performance characteristics of a linked list!
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=list_tree style="width: 200px; height: 200px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  with (new CFigure("list_tree")) {
    const u = undefined
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    align("LR", "TB", margin(),
        tree(lightStyle(), 1, u, [2, u, [3, u, ["...", u, "n"]]]))
  }
</script>
</div>
<p>
For this tree, \(h\) is \(O(n)\), and therefore the main tree operations are
\(O(n)\). Our goal is logarithmic performance, which requires \(h\) to be
\(O(\log n)\). A tree in which \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\) is said to be
<b>balanced</b>.  Fortunately, there are many ways to obtain balanced trees,
and we will see some of them.
</p>
<h3>Using binary search trees to implement maps</h3>
<p>
A map abstraction lets us associate values with keys and look up the value
corresponding to a given key. This functionality can be implemented easily
using a binary tree. We simply store both the key and its associated value in a
tree node and use the keys to order the nodes in the tree. Searching is performed
as above, but only comparing keys; when the key is
found, so is the associated value.  Alternatively, we can view the element
being stored in the tree as containing a key and a value, where elements are
compared only by looking at their keys.  This alternative view can be supported
by using a <code>Comparator</code> that only compares keys.
</p>
<h3>Removing elements from a binary search tree</h3>
<p>
Removing elements from a tree is generally more complicated than adding them, because the
elements to be removed are not necessarily leaves. The algorithm starts by first finding the
node containing the value \(x\) to be removed and its parent node \(p\) (if any).
Three cases must be considered:
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Node \(x\) is a leaf.</em>
<p>In this case, we <b>prune</b> node \(x\) from the tree by setting the
pointer to it from \(p\) to <code>null</code>. The other subtree of \(p\) (shown as
a white triangle, though it may be empty) is unchanged.</p>

<li><em>Node \(x\) has two children.</em>
<p>In this case it is not as easy to remove node \(x\). Instead, we
<b>replace</b> the data in the node with the data from either the immediate
next or the immediate previous element in the tree. Without loss of generality,
let's take the immediate next element; call it \(y\).  Since \(y\) is the
immediate next element, it must occur in the right subtree of node \(x\).
To find the immediate next element
\(y\) from \(x\), we walk one step down the tree to the right, then walk down
to the left as far as possible. The last node we
encounter is a node \(y\) that cannot possibly have a left child.  
</p>
<p>
Having found node \(y\), we remove it from the tree, either by <em>pruning</em>
it (if it is a leaf) or by
<em>splicing it out</em> (if it is not). Then, we overwrite the data in node \(x\) with
the data from node \(y\).

<p>
An alternative to overwriting the data in node \(x\) is
to replace the entire \(x\) node with the \(y\) node, which requires updating three
pointers: one child pointer in node \(p\) and both child pointers in the \(y\) node.
This alternative is preferable if the data to be overwritten is large or if some
external client has a reference to the original \(x\) node.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Removing an element from the tree requires walking along a path from the root to a leaf
in the worst case, plus some constant number of updates to the tree, so the time
required is \(O(h)\), as with searching and adding.
</p>

<h3>Supporting duplicate elements</h3>
<p>
For some applications, it may be useful to allow duplicate elements or keys.
To allow equal keys to be stored in the same tree, we need to relax the
BST invariant slightly. Given a node containing value \(x\), we must know whether
to go left or right to find the other occurrences of \(x\). To build a tree
where we go left, we relax the BST invariant so that the left subtree contains
keys less than <em>or equal</em> to \(x\), whereas the right subtree contains
keys strictly greater than x. Given a key \(k\), all of the nodes with the same
key can be found in time \(O(h)\) by walking down from the root.
</p>
<h3>N-ary search trees</h3>
<p>
It is possible to define search trees with more than two children per node. With a
higher branching factor, paths through the tree are shorter, but
the algorithms and invariants involved become considerably more complex. B-trees are an example of an N-ary
search tree structure. In an N-ary search tree, each node contains up to \(N-1\) elements
\(e_1,...,e_{N-1}\)
and has up to \(N\) children \(c_0,...,c_{N-1}\) arranged so that the subtrees of the children contain only
elements between successive elements at the node. If a node has \(n\) children, the node
contains \(n-1\) elements obeying the following ordering invariant:
</p>
<div class=figure>
\[
c_0 &lt; e_1 &lt; c_1 &lt; e_2 &lt; c_2 &lt; e_3 &lt; ･･･ &lt; e_{n-1} &lt; c_{n-1}
\]
</div>
<p>
Note that by formulas such as \(c_0 &lt; e_1 &lt;c_1\), we mean that <em>all</em> elements in subtree \(c_0\) are
less than \(e_1\) and all elements in \(c_1\) are greater than \(e_1\).
</p>
<p>
To search for a given element, we do a binary search on the elements \(e_i\)
(which are stored in ascending order). If the element is not found, the result of the
comparisons to these elements, in conjunction with the invariant, indicates
which child subtree to search.
</p>

<h3>Toward balanced trees</h3>
<p>
As observed above, binary search tree operations take \(O(h)\) time, which
could be as bad as \(O(n)\) time. What are our options for ensuring that trees
are balanced?
</p>
<p>
Algorithms exist for efficiently rebalancing trees, relying on adding
additional bookkeeping information to the tree data structure. For example,
AVL trees and Red–Black trees are two commonly used augmented versions of
binary search trees, with accompanying algorithms for rebalancing them.
However, they add significant complexity.
</p>
<p>
A simple way to obtain usually balanced search trees
is to insert elements into the tree in a random
order.
Random insertion turns out to create trees whose expected height is \(O(\log n)\)
(Proving this is outside the present scope, but see [<a
href="#references">1, Chapter 12.4</a>] or [<a href="#references">2, Lecture
13</a>] for a proof).
Of course, to be able to shuffle the elements randomly requires that the elements are
avaiable ahead of time. 
And if elements are not arriving in a random order already,
we need to know how to shuffle a collection of elements into a random order,
which involves a small digression to learn a useful algorithm.
</p>
<div class=digression>
<h3>How to place a sequence of elements in random order</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">
Fisher–Yates algorithm</a> (developed in 1938) places \(N\) elements into random
order. Recall that there are \(N! = 1×2×3×...×N\) possible permutations of \(N\) elements; a
perfectly random shuffle should have equal probability \(1/N!\) of producing any
given permutation. The algorithm works as follows. Assume we have the \(N\) elements
in an array \(a\). We iterate the array index \(i\) from \(N-1\) down to \(0\), deciding for each array index
which element to place into the array at that index. We randomly choose an index \(j\) between 0 and \(i\),
and swap the chosen element \(a[j]\) with the element at the current index:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="fisher-yates.java">fisher-yates.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
The first iteration generates one of \(N\) possible values, the second
iteration one of \(N-1\) possible values, and so on until the final iteration
generates one of two possible values. Therefore, the total number of possible
ways for the algorithm to execute is \( N × (N-1) × (N-2) × ･･･ × 2 = N!\),
which is equal to the total number of possible permutations of the array
elements.  Furthermore, given a particular permutation, there is exactly one
way for the algorithm to produce it, and all distinct executions of the algorithm
are equally likely. Therefore, all permutations are produced with equal
probability, assuming the random number generator is truly random.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Traversing trees</h2>
<p>
Given a tree containing some number of elements, it is sometimes useful to
<b>traverse</b> the tree, visiting each element and doing something with it,
such as printing it out or adding it to another collection.
</p>
<p>The most common traversal strategy is <b>in-order traversal</b>, in which
each element is visited between the elements of the subtrees. In-order traverse
can be expressed easily using recursion:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="inorder-traverse.java">inorder</a>
</pre>
<p>(Here the <code>visit</code> method is just some function that does something with the data.)
For example, consider using this algorithm on the following binary search tree:</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=traverse_tree style="width: 150px; height: 100px"> </canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  const traverse_fig = new CFigure("traverse_tree")
  with (traverse_fig) {
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(lightStyle(), 5, [3, 1, undefined], [11, 10, 17])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin())
  }
</script>
</div>
<p>
The elements will be visited in the order 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 17.
</p>
<p>
The traversal is not tail-recursive and therefore cannot be easily converted into a loop,
but this is not a problem unless the tree is very deep. If iterative traversal is required, it
can be done if nodes contain parent pointers, or with a stack to remember the nodes in the path
from the root down to the node currently being visited.
</p>
<p>
Note that an in-order traversal of a binary search tree visits the elements in sorted order.
This observation gives us an asymptotically efficient sorting
algorithm. Given a collection of elements to sort, we first shuffle them
into a random order, then add them one at a time into a BST, taking \(O(hn)\) time.
Because the elements are in random order, the expected height h is \(O(\log n)\),
so adding all the elements takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
Then we can use an in-order traversal, taking \(O(n)\) time, to extract all the
elements in their proper order. While no general sorting algorithm is more efficient
asymptotically than \(O(n \log n)\), we will later see some other sorting algorithms
that are just as asymptotically efficient but have lower constant factors.
</p>
<p> Since it is easy to visit elements in sorted order, search trees also
support efficient <b>range queries</b>. Given two elements, we can find all
elements between them, in sorted order, by doing modifying the in-order
traversal to skip parts of the tree that are outside the desired range. If a
node's element is above the range, then its right subtree can be skipped
entirely; symmetrically, if the element is below the range, its left subtree
can be skipped.
</p>
<p>
Other traversals than in-order can be done.
By visiting a node <i>before</i> visiting either of its children,
we obtain <b>preorder</b> traversal. By visiting a node <i>after</i> visiting both of its children,
we obtain <b>postorder</b> traversal.
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="pre-order-traverse.java">pre</a>
</pre>
<pre class=load>
<a href="postorder-traverse.java">post</a>
</pre>
<p>
For example, a preorder traversal of the tree above would visit the nodes in the order 5, 3, 1, 11, 10, 17, and a postorder traversal would visit the nodes in the order 1, 3, 10, 17, 11, 5.
</p>
<p>
Postorder traversals have the useful property that a node is visited only after
all of its descendants; conversely, a preorder traversal visits a node before
all of its descendants.
</p>
<h3>Parent pointers</h3>
<p>
So far we have only had pointers going downward in the tree. It is sometimes
handy to have pointers going from nodes to their parents, much as nodes in a
doubly linked list contain pointers to their predecessor nodes. Parent pointers
can simplify some algorithms, but they do take up space and require enforcing
additional invariants: in particular, that the parent of the root node is null
and that for any node \(n\), the parents of its children (if any) are equal to \(n\):
\[\texttt{n} ∈ \{\texttt{n.parent.left}, \texttt{n.parent.right}\} \]
\[\texttt{n.right.parent} = \texttt{n}\]
\[\texttt{n.left.parent} = \texttt{n}\]
</p>
<p>
Using parent pointers, it is possible to implement tree traversals in an
iterative way, without relying on a stack. When the last child of a node has
been visited, the algorithm follows the parent pointer from the node to its
parent and continues with the next child of the parent.

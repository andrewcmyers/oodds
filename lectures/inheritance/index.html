<h1>Inheritance and the specialization interface</h1>

<p>
Recall that we identified three key elements of OO programming:
</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Subtyping</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
</ul>

<p>
We now discuss the third of these, <em>inheritance</em>.
Inheritance is a mechanism that supports extensibility and reuse of
code, both across programs and within programs.
</p>

<h2>Motivating example</h2>

<p>
Suppose someone gives us an implementation of the <code>Puzzle</code> interface
that we saw in the previous lecture. In the <code>APuzzle</code> implementation, the puzzle is
represented by a 2D array of integers:
</p>

<pre>
class APuzzle implements Puzzle {
   private int[][] tiles;

   public int tile(int r, int c) {
      return tiles[r][c];
   }
   public void move(Direction d) { ... }
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Now suppose that we want to build a better puzzle implementation by
reusing this code. For example, we might want the puzzle to
log all of the moves that have been made. We could proceed by
copying the code of <code>APuzzle</code> to create a new class <code>LogPuzzle</code>, which
we could then add new fields and methods to. But this strategy doesn't work
very well when the original supplier of <code>APuzzle</code> fixes some bugs and
gives us a new version <code>APuzzle'</code>. Now we have to either apply the same bug fixes to
<code>LogPuzzle</code> on the code that we copied from <code>APuzzle</code>
to get a new </code>LogPuzzle'</code>,
or start afresh from <code>APuzzle'</code> and build a new <code>LogPuzzle'</code> from it.
Either way, it will be a lot of work and difficult to automate.

    connector(l1, l3).setLineWidth(2).setEndArrow("arrow")
    connector(l2, l4).setLineWidth(2).setEndArrow("arrow").setLineDash([4,4])
    connector(l3, l4).setLineWidth(2).setEndArrow("arrow").setLineDash([4,4])
}
</script>

<p>
At least for some kinds of changes that we might make between
<code>APuzzle</code> and <code>LogPuzzle</code>, <b>inheritance</b> offers a solution to this
problem. We can think of inheritance as a language mechanism for
<i>copying</i> a class and making certain kinds of changes to that class, without
actually physically copying the code.
</p><p>
To add the new functionality to <code>APuzzle</code>, we build a new class
<code>LogPuzzle</code> that inherits all the functionality from <code>APuzzle</code>.
This is done by declaring that <code>LogPuzzle</code> <b>extends</b> <code>APuzzle</code>:
</p>

<pre>
class LogPuzzle extends APuzzle {
   private int numMoves;

   public int numMoves() {
      return numMoves;
   }

   public void move(Direction d) {
      numMoves++;
      super.move(d);
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
Here <code>APuzzle</code> is the <em>superclass</em> and <code>LogPuzzle</code> is the <em>subclass</em>.
In general, classes inheriting from other classes form an <em>inheritance
hierarchy</em> or <em>class hierarchy</em>, in which superclasses are above their
subclasses.
</p><p>
The <code>LogPuzzle</code> class is just like the <code>APuzzle</code> class, except:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>
It has an additional method, <code>numMoves</code>, and a
new field, <code>numMoves</code>, that <code>APuzzle</code> does not have.
</li>
<li> It has a new version of the <code>move</code> method that <em>overrides</em> the original
version from <code>APuzzle</code>. It overrides the original because it has the
same name and signature as the original method. (Recall that the <em>signature</em>
consists of the name of the method, the types of its arguments, and its return type.)
</li>
<li> The type <code>LogPuzzle</code> is a subtype of the type <code>APuzzle</code>. That
is, <code>LogPuzzle</code> &lt;: <code>APuzzle</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method dispatch and inheritance</h2>
<p>
Because of the subtyping relationship between the two classes, we
can write the following code:
</p>
<pre>
APuzzle p = new LogPuzzle();
p.move(up); // which move?
</pre>

<p class="cont">
Now here is an interesting question. There are <code>move</code> methods in
both <code>LogPuzzle</code> and <code>APuzzle</code>, and they do different
things. Which one is executed in the call <code>p.move(up)</code>? The
<em>static</em> type of <code>p</code> is <code>APuzzle</code>, but at the time
of the call, <code>p</code> refers to an object of <em>dynamic</em> type
<code>LogPuzzle</code>.</p>

<p>In Java, instance (non-static) methods such as <code>move</code> are dispatched according to the
dynamic type of the receiver object (the class from which it was originally created via <code>new</code>).
So it is the <code>LogPuzzle</code> version that is run. This is known as <em>dynamic dispatch</em>.
</p>

<p>
As a slightly more complicated example, suppose the
superclass <code>APuzzle</code> has a method <code>scramble</code> that calls <code>move</code>,
but <code>LogPuzzle</code> does not have a <code>scramble</code> method:
</p>

<pre>
class APuzzle {
   public void scramble() {
      ... move(randomDir) ...
   }
}

APuzzle p = new LogPuzzle();
p.scramble();
// is p.numMoves() equal to 0?
</pre>

<p>
When <code>p.scramble()</code> is called, the <code>scramble</code> method of
<code>APuzzle</code> is invoked. But when that method calls <code>move</code>,
which version of <code>move</code> is dispatched?
It is the <code>move</code> method of <code>LogPuzzle</code>. The
<code>move</code> method is still an instance method, and as above, the method
dispatch mechanism starts at the dynamic class of the receiver object and
searches upward until finding an implementation. In this case it finds one
immediately in the <code>LogPuzzle</code> class, and that is the one that is
dispatched.
</p>

<p>
There are two different ways to understand how inheritance works when an instance
method is invoked. One way is to say that the system <i>searches
upward</i> through the inheritance hierarchy starting at the dynamic type of the object,
looking for the first implementation of the method. But it is (almost) equivalent to say that the
methods from the superclasses are <i>copied down</i> to their subclasses,
except when overridden.</p>

<p>
We say "almost" because there are some cases where code cannot be naively
copied down verbatim.  For example, a method in the superclass can refer to a
instance variable in the superclass that is <i>shadowed</i> by a instance
variable of the same name in a subclass. If the method in the superclass refers
to this instance variable, then it still refers to the same instance variable
even after it is copied down to the subclass.  The identity of the instance
variable being named is fixed at the time the superclass is compiled.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider these class definitions:
</p>
<pre>
class A {
   int x = 3;
   void print() {
      System.out.println(x);
   }
}

class B extends A {
   int x = 4;
   void print() {
      System.out.println(x);
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
If you write <code>A a = new B(); a.print()</code>, then <code>4</code> will be
printed (dynamic dispatch!). However, if you got rid of the <code>print</code>
method in <code>B</code>, say</p>
<pre>
class A {
   int x = 3;
   void print() {
      System.out.println(x);
   }
}

class B extends A {
   int x = 4;
}
</pre>
<p>and then said <code>B b = new B(); b.print()</code>, then <code>3</code>
would be printed. When the inherited method refers to <code>x</code>, it
still refers to the original, shadowed instance variable rather than the
newly declared one.
</p>

<h2>Inheritance and static methods</h2>

<p>
Static methods complicate the story slightly, because they cannot be
overridden by subclasses. Unlike instance methods, the choice of what version to call is based
purely on static information available at compile time, before the program is run.
The version that is invoked is the version of the class to which
the method belongs, and does not change when
the code making the call is inherited by a subclass. Consider the
following code:
</p>

<pre>
class A {
   static int f() { ... }
   void g() {
      f();
   }
}

class B extends A {
   static int f() { ... }
}

A x = new B();
x.g();
</pre>

<p>
Classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> both have static methods <code>f()</code>.
When the method <code>g()</code> is called, the call to <code>f()</code> inside
<code>g()</code> invokes the <code>A</code>
version of <code>f</code> rather than the <code>B</code> version. Because <code>f</code> is a static
method, the call to <code>f()</code> is exactly the same as if it were written
<code>A.f()</code>. It does not change in meaning when it is inherited
by <code>B</code>.
</p><p>
The special syntax <code>super.f()</code> is also a static call that always
invokes the parent class's version of <code>f</code>.
</p>

<h2>Constructors</h2>

<p>
<em>Constructors</em> are special static methods that are called with <code>new</code>
to create and initialize new instances of the class. If the programmer does not specify
a constructor, there is an implicit one with no arguments that just creates the object
but doesn't do anything else. If the programmer specifies an explicit constructor,
the implicit constructor with no arguments is no longer available.
In that case, the constructors of a subclass must call a
superclass constructor explicitly, as in the following example:
</p>

<pre>
class APuzzle {
   private int[][] tiles;
   public APuzzle(int size) {
      tiles = new int[size][size];
   }
}

class LogPuzzle extends APuzzle {
   private int numMoves;
   public LogPuzzle() {
      super(4);
      numMoves = 0;
   }
}
</pre>

<p class="cont">
Here, the constructor <code>LogPuzzle</code> always creates puzzles of
size 4×4, which is accomplished by calling the superclass constructor
with <code>super(4)</code>. The call to the superclass constructor is static.
</p>

<h2>Protected visibility</h2>

<p>
What if we want the <code>LogPuzzle</code> code to access the <code>tiles</code> field
directly? As defined, we cannot, because <code>tiles</code> is declared <code>private</code>.
However, if we give <code>tiles</code> the <code>protected</code> visibility in
<code>APuzzle</code>, it becomes visible to subclasses:
</p>
<pre>
class APuzzle {
   protected int[][] tiles;
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Protected fields and methods form a second interface to a class.
Public methods and fields are the <em>public interface</em>, which is exposed
to client code. Protected methods and fields are the <em>specialization
interface</em>, which is available to subclasses but not to ordinary
clients. One of the challenges of good object-oriented design is to
design both of these interfaces effectively, without confusing their
roles. Designing a good specialization interface is especially
important for object-oriented libraries where the classes provided
by the library are intended to be extended through inheritance.
</p>

<h2>Protected methods and the specialization interface</h2>

<p>
Suppose that <code>scramble()</code> had been defined to call a protected method
<code>internalMove</code> instead of the public <code>move</code> method:
</p>

<pre>
class APuzzle {
   public void scramble() {
      ... internalMove(n); ...
   }
   protected void internalMove(int d) { ... }
}

class LogPuzzle extends APuzzle {
   private int numMoves = 0;
   protected void internalMove(int d) {
      numMoves++;
      super.internalMove(d);
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
This example shows that the specialization interface of <code>APuzzle</code>
allows the <code>LogPuzzle</code> class to change the behavior of existing
public methods without overriding them directly. Protected methods
are hooks for future extensibility of OO code. The specialization
interface defines how code can be extended.
</p>

<h2>Abstract classes</h2>
<p>
An abstract class is a class that provides some state and behavior that
can be inherited by other classes, but that cannot be instantiated with <code>new</code>.
Thus an abstract class cannot be the dynamic class
of any object. An abstract class, indicated by the keyword <code>abstract</code>
in the class declaration, may similarly declare methods that are marked
<code>abstract</code>. Such methods do not need to come with an implementation,
but any non-abstract subclass must implement them.
</p>
<p>
Abstract classes are useful as a way to factor out and centralize common
functionality needed by a group of related classes. Using inheritance in this
way is much better than copying the code and state into all the classes,
because the code occurs only in one place.
</p>
<p>
One useful pattern is to use such methods as holes in the implementation to be
filled in by subclasses. In this case, the <code>protected</code> visibility
is appropriate because the methods are not intended to be used directly by
clients.

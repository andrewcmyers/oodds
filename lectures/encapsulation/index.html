<h1>Encapsulation and Information Hiding</h1>

<h2>The object-oriented programming model</h2>
<p>
A major topic of this course is object-oriented design. We use an
object-oriented language, Java, as a vehicle for exploring object-oriented
design.
</p>
<p>
It is useful to distinguish between object-oriented (OO) <em>languages</em> and
the object-oriented <b>programming model</b>. A programming model is an
approach to solving programming problems. There are many programming
models and variants thereof. For example, in addition to the
object-oriented model, there is a <b>functional</b> programming model that
you might learn about in a course on functional programming, like
Cornell's CS 3110. And there are variations on the
object-oriented model such as the <b>event-driven</b> model.
</p>
<p>
Some languages are designed to support some programming models better
than others, and it makes sense to use an OO language like Java for
learning OO design. But this course is not primarily about Java. It is a
course about object-oriented design (and other computer science
topics), and the lessons you learn about object-oriented design should
apply to other programming languages.
</p>
<h2>Elements of OO programming</h2>
<p>
What makes a language object-oriented? It should support the essential
elements of object-oriented programming. There are three key elements,
which we will discuss in upcoming lectures:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Information Hiding (also called Encapsulation)</li>
<li>Subtyping</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
</ol>

<p>
We'll start by talking about information hiding, an idea that Java supports
with the keywords <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and
<code>protected</code>. The use of these keywords prevents code and
data from being used, which may seem strange: why is it important
to take power away from the programmer? The answer is that limiting
access supports <b>modularity</b>.
</p>

<p>
In early programming languages, the information manipulated by the
program got short shrift. Programs were organized around the
algorithms doing the computation, as illustrated in
Figure 1. Those algorithms had full access to the data that they
were computing with. This is the procedural model of programming.
It involves building bigger procedures out of smaller ones, creating
<b>procedural abstractions</b> that could be reused in a powerful way.
</p>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>
What do we mean by <b>abstraction</b>? In computer science, abstraction
means the suppression of unnecessary details about the implementation
of some part of a program. Abstraction is helpful because it lets us use
code without understanding exactly what is going on internally. Abstraction
allows us to use functionality without having to confront and understand the
full complexity of its implementation. Since humans have only finite memory
and attention to spare, abstraction is an essential principle for engineering
complex systems.
</p>
<p>
Procedures (and here, the term encompasses functions that return a result) are
abstractions because they abstract away the details of how algorithms are
implemented. Assuming that the procedure's behavior is well specified, a caller
can use a procedure without knowing the internals of the procedure.
</p>
<h3>Modularity vs. Tight Coupling</h3>
<p>
As software systems became increasingly complex, the procedural model stopped
working well. Procedural abstraction by itself did not scale
up to big software systems. The problem was that the
procedural model offers no control over
which program code can access a given part of the data. Code
can reach into the program data and use it or update in an arbitrary
way. Working on a team of programmers is difficult in the procedural
model because the different parts of the code tend to be <b>tightly coupled</b>.
A bug in one software component can corrupt program data and look like a bug in
a different component. Code is hard to maintain and to evolve without
breaking it, and changes to the way data is represented in the program tend to
affect all of the program code rather than being isolated to a small part 
of the code. It was difficult to divide a large programming task into pieces
that developers could work on somewhat independently. Procedural programming
lacked sufficient <b>modularity</b>.
</p>

<h2>Modular programming</h2>
<p>
To address these problems, <b>modular programming</b> was developed.
(Object-oriented programming is a form of modular programming, but adds more
ideas.) The idea of modular programming is that the
software should be broken up into distinct <b>modules</b> that can be
developed separately. A good modular design respects the
principle of <b>separation of concerns</b>, which says that different aspects
of the design should be kept separate in the code. With a good modular design,
changes can be made to one module without changing other modules, and it is
relatively easy for programmers to know whether their changes will affect other
modules that are perhaps owned by other programmers. Separation of concerns
is strengthened by <b>information hiding</b> in which modules do not take
advantage of knowledge about how other modules are
implemented. Information hiding provides <b>loose coupling</b> that tends
to make code evolution easier. In a loosely coupled system, changes to
the way information is represented or modules are implemented
tend to propagate less to other modules, much as loosely coupled train cars
can start moving without trying to move the whole train.
</p>
<p>
A key insight in programming language design was that modular programming can
be enforced by a programming language mechanism that <b>encapsulates</b> the
state and behavior of a module, enforcing information hiding and controlling how other
modules can access it. This approach is suggested by Figure 2.  Code outside a
module cannot directly access the data that is internal to the module. Any
access from outside to a module's data must occur via the module's code, and
only the code that the module chooses to expose to the outside. Access to the
data is <b>mediated</b> by this public code.
</p>
<p>
By <b>client code</b> we mean code outside the module that is using the
module through a set of publicly exposed operations. These operations were
called the <b>interface</b> of the module, which should not be confused
with the Java language feature <code>interface</code> (which is, however, an
example of the more general interface idea, and one we will return to).
</p>
<p>
The interface that a module exposes to client code is a kind of contract with
the rest of the program. The idea of modular programming is that if every module
lives up to its contract, the whole program will work correctly. Programmers
can then think about and program each module in isolation from the rest.
Instead of thinking about the correctness of the entire program, a
bewilderingly complex problem, they can just think about the correctness of the
particular module they are working on now.  This nice property of modular
programming is called <b>local reasoning</b>.
</p>
<p>
Modules also make it possible to use data from other modules without knowing
exactly how that data is represented. All they have to know is what operations
(from the public interface) can be performed on the data. The data is opaque
to the client code, which means that the module implementer is free to change
how the data is represented because no client code can depend on the precise
representation.  This powerful form of information hiding is called <b>data
abstraction</b>.  In this case, the inessential detail being abstracted away
is, for the client code, the precise way that information is represented inside
the module.
</p>

<h2>An example: rational numbers</h2>
<p>
In an object-oriented language like Java, encapsulation
is primarily provided by classes, though <b>packages</b> are also
used as an encapsulation mechanism. A class and its code are shared by all objects of
that class (the <b>instances</b> of the class), and the class's code can
mediate access to all information stored in instances. For example, suppose we
want objects that act like rational numbers, allowing us to write code like the
following, using a class <code>Rational</code>:
</p>

<pre class="load">
<a href="src/Main.java">Main.java</a>
</pre>

<p>
Such a class provides operations that allow us to think of its
values as simply rational numbers, because only the operations
of rationals are exposed. The internal representation can be hidden.
Thus, a class like <code>Rational</code> is said to implement an
<b>abstract data type</b> (<b>ADT</b>).
</p>
<p>
A class implementing rational numbers is shown here (you can click on code examples to
download them).
</p>

<div class="figure">
<pre class="load">
<a href="src/Rational.java">Rational.java</a>
</pre>
<span class=caption>
  Example: Rational numbers
</span>
</div>

<p>
Several interesting things are going on in this implementation. We start out
with a very important comment, called the <b>class overview</b>. This
describes how client
code programmers should think about the values of class <code>Rational</code>. 
To the client, the objects are simply rational numbers, with a numerator \(p\) and a denominator \(q\).
The overview also gives the client a notation for talking about these objects abstractly, as a fraction \(p/q\).
Having a notation for objects of the class is helpful for expressing the specifications of the methods.
</p>
<p>
The data in
<code>Rational</code> objects is the fields <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, with type <code>int</code>.
This is just one possible representation of rational numbers. For example, it would probably be better
to make the types of these fields <code>long</code> or even use <code>BigInteger</code>. We could also
imagine keeping track of the sign of the number in a separate boolean field, leaving both <code>p</code>
and </code>q</code> as
nonnegative numbers. The point is that the client <em>doesn't</em> and
<em>shouldn't</em> need to know how the number is represented internally. The
client should think of the objects of class <code>Rational</code> as simply
rational numbers.
</p><p>
The instance variables of the class are marked <code>private</code>
to ensure that they are encapsulated inside the class. The keywords
<code>public</code> and <code>private</code> are known as <b>visibility
modifiers</b>, because they control which parts of the class are visible
outside the class, and hence can be accessed. Marking instance variables
as <code>private</code> enforces the abstraction barrier between
the implementation of the ADT <code>Rational</code> and the client code that
uses it.
</p><p>
The methods <code>add</code> and <code>equals</code> and the constructor
<code>Rational</code> are marked <code>public</code> and hence can be used by
external clients.
</p>
<p>
Inside the method <code>add</code>, there is a special variable <code>this</code> that
refers to the object on which the method was invoked, called the
<b>receiver object</b>. It happens that <code>add</code> does not mention <code>this</code>
explicitly, but it does refer to the fields of <code>this</code> as <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
Writing these names is equivalent to writing <code>this.p</code> and <code>this.q</code>
respectively.
</p><p>
The method <code>plus</code> is a <b>static</b> method, which means that it does not
have a receiver object. The special variable <code>this</code> is not <b>in scope</b>
in a static method. That means it cannot be used within the method. A
static method should be called using the name of its class, as in the
following code:
</p>
<pre>
Rational r3 = Rational.plus(r1, r2);
</pre>
<p>
It is also possible to declare fields to be static, in which
case they are shared by all objects of their class.
</p>

<h2>Visibility modifiers</h2>
<p>
As we have seen, the annotations <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> can be used
to control which code outside a class can access its components. The full list of visibility
modifiers follows:
</p>
<table class=rowlines>
<tr><th>Modifier</th><th>Significance</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>public</code></td>
<td>Accessible everywhere.</td>
<td>Instance variables should almost never be public. Public static class variables
can be useful if they are made <code>final</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>private</code></td>
<td>Accessible only within the class.</td>
<td>The safest choice, but may limit future extensibility via inheritance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(no modifier)</td>
<td>Accessible from classes in the same package.</td>
<td>Does not apply to nested packages.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>protected</code></td>
<td>Accessible from subclasses and other classes in the same package</td>
<td>Only relevant in programs that use inheritance.</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Preconditions and postconditions</h2>

<p>The specification of the constructor has a Requires clause stating that
the argument <code>den</code> must be non-zero. This clause is a form of
<b>precondition</b> that must be satisfied by any correct client implementation.
It is a mistake for client code to call the constructor without satisfying
the precondition: in particular, it is a mistake by the programmer writing the client code. The module implementer is allowed to assume that all calls
satisfy the precondition.
Thus, when mistakes are made, preconditions help us figure out whose fault they are.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, <b>postconditions</b> (sometimes called Returns clauses) specify
what a method is supposed to do. If a method doesn't satisfy its postcondition,
the mistake is not the client's; it's the implementer's. Client code can be
written with the assumption that the precondition of the method is satisfied,
the method result correspondingly satisfies the postcondition.
</p>
<p>
WIth clear preconditions and postconditions, the public interface of the class
forms a contract between the client and the implementer. Like legal
contracts in law, contracts allow blame to be assigned when someone makes
a mistake. For large software projects with multiple developers,
clear assignment of responsibility is extremely valuable!
</p>

<h2>Class invariants</h2>
<p>
An early comment in the <code>Rational</code> example expresses an
<b>invariant</b> regarding instance variables <code>p</code> and
<code>q</code>:</p>
<pre class=code>
 // class invariant: q &gt; 0, gcd(p, q) = 1
</pre>
<p>
In other words, this invariant states that <code>q</code> is
positive and that the rational number is always stored in the reduced form
where <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are relatively prime.
</p>
<p>
An invariant is something that is always true at certain points in the program,
though in programming, invariants can be violated temporarily. This particular invariant is an
invariant about the state of objects of the class, and is variously called a
<b>class invariant</b>, <b>data structure invariant</b>, or
<b>representation invariant</b>.
A class invariant is expected
to hold at the beginning and end of every public method, but may be temporarily violated
in the middle of a method.
</p>
<p>
Knowing that the class invariant is true is very helpful because when writing
the code for the methods of the class, you can assume that the invariant holds.
For example, in the implementation of the method <code>Rational.plus</code>, we
may safely ignore the possibility of a zero denominator. 
Having invariants that you can rely on makes it much simpler to
write working code!
</p>
<p>
Conversely, a class invariant creates an
<i>obligation</i> for the programmer:
the class invariant must hold for all objects of the class when
methods and constructors return. In particular, the constructor
for <code>Rational</code> must only create objects that satisfy
the invariant.
</p>
<p>
It is much easier to establish and reason about invariants if the code that
enforces the invariant is localized to one class, as a class invariant (or, at
least, to a small number of classes in a package).
</p>
<p>
Encapsulation aids with this goal of localization.  Because the instance
variables <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are private, the code of the class
can enforce this invariant. Code outside the current class has no way to, say,
modify <code>q</code> to be zero.  Conversely, we can see that making any
assignable field public completely destroys the ability to enforce class
invariants involving that field: client code might assign an arbitrary value to
the field.
</p>
<p>
Like the method <code>plus</code>, the class constructor, which must
also be named <code>Rational</code> like its class, is also static in
the sense that it is not called using a receiver object. Unlike in a
static method, the variable <code>this</code> and its instance variables
<em>are</em> in scope inside the constructor. They refer to the instance
variables of the object currently being constructed. Notice that the
constructor does not simply accept the numerator and denominator
directly, but instead computes a new numerator and denominator that
represent the same number while satisfying the invariant. This
computation ensures that at the end of the constructor, the invariant
holds.
</p><p>
Because of the invariant, the method <code>equals</code> can be
implemented very simply and efficiently, by comparing the corresponding
instance variables of <code>this</code> and <code>r</code>. This
implementation relies on the fact that the invariant we chose ensures
there is only one way to represent a given rational number. In general,
it is not required that there be a unique representation for any
rational number, but it's handy here.  Without the invariant, we would
have to write something more expensive like the following:
</p><pre>
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    ...
    return (p*r.q == q*r.p);
  }
</pre><p class="cont">
There is no free lunch here, of course.  We had to pay up front for the
simplicity of <code>equals</code> (and <code>toString</code>), by enforcing the
invariant elsewhere in the code.
</p>
<p>
What conditions are part of the class invariant?  A rule of thumb is that the
class invariant should enforce everything that is assumed by the method
implementations of the class. We might imagine that we are writing the code of
the class in collaboration with another not-very-competent programmer who tries
to make our method implementations break by writing code that changes the
instance variables of class objects.  The only constraint on this adversarial
collaborator is that they can change instance variables only in ways that the
class invariant permits. Therefore, a fully correct class invariant should
prevent instance variables from being changed in a way that causes any method
implementations to malfunction.
</p>
<h2>Assertions</h2>
<p>
Preconditions and postconditions define a contract between the client and the
implementer, and class invariants are an internal contract between the module
implementation and itself.  If everyone is obeying their contracts, the program
works.  But if someone doesn't follow their part of a contract, the program
may fail in a way that is hard to debug.  How can we gain confidence that these
contracts are all being obeyed?
</p><p>
Using <b>assertions</b> is very helpful for catching these contract
violations and speeding up debugging. The <code>assert</code> statement stops
the program (with an <code>AssertionError</code>) if the tested condition is
false. Assertions can be used to double-check that anything the programmer 
believes ought to be true, actually is. While this has some performance impact,
assertions can be turned off for production code.
</p>
<p>Assertions (using <code>assert</code>) are extremely useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>They put useful tests into the code itself where you don't have to remember to run them.</li>
<li>They also add useful documentation about things the implementer expected to be true, so they
don't clutter the code in the process.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Controlling assertions</h3>

<p>
One thing to watch out for with assertions is that they are
turned off by default!  You should always have them turned on
when developing code. This is achieved by giving the Java VM the
<tt>-ea</tt> flag. We recommend setting this flag by default for your
projects.  If you are using Eclipse, you can find this setting in
Preferences→Java→Installed JREs→Edit, where you set &ldquo;Default
VM arguments&rdquo; to <tt>-ea</tt>. In IntelliJ, you can find it in
the run configuration at Run→Edit Configurations→(select or add
configuration)→Modify options→Add VM Options.  Other IDEs allow VM
arguments to be set similarly.
</p>
<p>You might be worried that checking preconditions is very expensive. Fortunately, assertion checking can be turned on and off selectively
by providing options to the JVM:
<ul>
<li><tt>-ea</tt> : enable assertions everywhere except in system libraries
<li><tt>-esa</tt> : enable assertions in system libraries
<li><tt>-ea:&lt;classname&gt;</tt> : enable assertions in class <tt>&lt;classname&gt;</tt>
<li><tt>-ea:&lt;packagename&gt;</tt> : enable assertions in all classes in this package and subpackages.
</ul>

<p>Corresponding <tt>-da</tt> options can be used to turn off assertion checking selectively.</p>

<h3>Checking preconditions and postconditions</h3>
<p>But what to use <code>assert</code> on? One obvious target is preconditions and postconditions.
On entry to a method, use an <code>assert</code> to check that the requires clause holds. On
every exit from a method, check that the returns clause is satisfied. If a method fails to live
up to its spec, you'll know immediately and be able to debug the right code.
</p>
<pre>
/* Requires/Checks: X
 * Returns: Y
 */
m() {
    assert X;
    ...// method impl here
    assert Y;
    return;
}
</pre>
<h3>Checking class invariants</h3>
<p>
Checking preconditions and postconditions is very useful, but a further
important technique for building working code is to also check
class invariants using assertions. Class invariants can be checked at
the beginning of each public method and also at the end of each method,
to make sure that any violation of the invariant is caught as soon as
possible. Further, constructors should check the class invariant to make
sure that newly constructed objects already satisfy it.
</p>
<p>
To make it convenient to check the class invariant, we write a method
<code>classInv</code> to do the checking. Such a method has the added benefit
that it precisely describes what the class invariant, as executable code.
Writing the code for this method can also help clarify your thinking about what
belongs in the class invariant.
</p>
<p>For example, in the <code>Rational</code> our class invariant
was that the denominator must be positive and the numerator and
denominator are relatively prime. These conditions can be
expressed as a <code>classInv()</code> method:
<pre class="load">
<a href="src/withAssertions/classInv.java">withAssertions.classInv</a>
</pre>

<h3>Example: Adding assertions to <code>Rational</code></h3>

<p>
If the code of our example class <code>Rational</code>, is augmented with
assertions to check preconditions, postconditions, and the class invariant, we
arrive at an implementation that uses assertions as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<pre class="load">
<a href="src/withAssertions/Rational.java">withAssertions.Rational</a>
</pre>
<span class="caption">
Example: class <code>Rational</code> with assertions added to check class invariants and preconditions
</span>
</div>

<h2>Names and packages</h2>
<p>
Classes in Java live in <b>packages</b>. For example, the class <code>String</code>
is really a shorthand for the <b>fully qualified class name</b> <code>java.lang.String</code>,
where <code>java.lang</code> is the name of a Java package containing many standard
Java types.
</p>
<p>
The dot symbol <code>.</code> is used for several things in Java. As we've seen earlier,
it is used to indicate use of a method or field. Beyond this, it is used to indicate
which package a class lives in. Package
names can have dots inside them, and those happen to define how Java
source code and compiled code are stored in the file system of the computer.
Perhaps surprisingly, it is incorrect to think of <code>java.lang</code> as being
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; the package <code>java</code>. In particular, something
that is made visible just to classes in the <code>java</code> package will
not be visible to classes in the <code>java.lang</code> package, or vice versa.
These are two different packages whose names happen to be related.
</p>
<p>
When referring to a class in a different package, it is necessary either to
use the fully qualified name for those classes or to use an
<code>import</code> statement at the top of the source file. Thus, we can write
the fully qualified class name <code>cs2112.lec03.Rational</code> to refer to
the <code>Rational</code> class from a package other than
<code>cs2112.lec03</code>; alternatively, we can write a statement <code>import
cs2112.lec03.Rational;</code> at the top of the file and then just refer to the
class as <code>Rational</code>. It is also possible to use a <b>wildcard
import</b> to import all classes in a single package: for example, <code>import
cs2112.lec03.*;</code>. In fact, the entire package <code>java.lang</code> is
automatically imported in this way, which is why we can talk about classes like
<code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> without qualifying their names.
In general, however, the danger of a wildcard import is that it may import
many classes you don't need, creating confusion about what some names refer to.
It is usually better to import just the classes you are actually using.

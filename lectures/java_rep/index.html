<h1>Representing Java Values</h1>

<h2>The Java language abstraction vs. hardware implementation</h2>
<p>
The Java language is an abstraction. Java is implemented on top of hardware
using a compiler and the software for its run-time system, presenting you with
the illusion that there are really ints, booleans, objects, and so forth.  In
reality there are circuits and electrons. For most part, you can ignore the
lower-level details of what is really happening when Java programs run. That's
because the Java abstraction is very effective. But computer scientists ought
to have a model of how computers really work.
</p>

<h2>Memory, memory addresses, and words</h2>

<p>
The computer memory is actually a big grid in which a bit is stored at every
intersection. But the hardware itself offers a more abstract view of memory as
a big array. The memory can be accessed using <strong>memory addresses</strong> that
start at 0 and go up to some large number (usually 2<sup>32</sup> or
2<sup>64</sup>, depending on whether the computer is 32-bit or 64-bit).
Each address names a group of 8 bits (a <strong>byte</strong>). However, usually
computer memories give back multiple bytes at once. When given an address
divisible by four, the computer memory can read the four bytes beginning
at that address, containing 32 bits. These four bytes are called a <strong>word</strong>.
On 64-bit machines, the memory can fetch 64 bits at a time; for simplicity
we'll call a set of eight bytes a <strong>double word</strong>.

<h2>Integral types (<code>int</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>byte</code>) and signed (two's-complement) representations.</h2>

<p>
Internally, computers represent numbers using binary (base 2) numbers rather
than the decimal (base 10) representations we've grown up with. In base 2,
there are only two possible digits, 0 and 1, which can be represented in the
computer's hardware as a switch that is turned off or on, or a voltage that is
low or high.
</p>
<p>
Binary digits stand for coefficients on powers of two rather than on
powers of ten, so 1101<sub>2</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> + 4<sub>10</sub> + 0 + 1 = 13<sub>10</sub>.
(Note that we write a subscript 2 or 10 to indicate the base of a number when there is
ambiguity.)
</p>
<p>
In base 10, a number of <span class=m>n</span> digits can represent any number from 0 up to but not including
the number 10<sup><span class=m>n</span></sup>. For example, in three decimal digits we can
represent any number between 0 and \( 999 = 10^3 - 1\).  Similarly, <span class=m>n</span> binary digits can
represent any number from 0 up to 2<sup>n</sup>-1. Therefore, a byte containing
8 bits could represent any number between 0 and 255, since 2<sup>8</sup> = 256. The Java <code>char</code>
type is a 16-bit number, so it can have any value between 0 and 2<sup>16</sup>-1 = 65535. A 32-bit word
can represent any number between 0 and 2<sup>32</sup>-1 = 4294967295.
</p>
<p>That may sound good enough for most uses, but what about negative numbers? To handle them, we
need a way to represent the sign of a number.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="integral.png" alt="integral types" />
</div>
    <ol>
	<li>Signed: <code>int</code> (32 bits), <code>short</code> (16 bits), <code>long</code> (64 bits), <code>byte</code> (8 bits)</li>
	<li>Unsigned: <code>char</code> (16 bits, 0&ndash;65535)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Two's complement representation</strong>: in a signed n-bit representation, the most
    significant bit stands for -2<sup>n-1</sup> instead of 2<sup>n&minus;1</sup>,
    which would be its value in the unsigned representation we have been discussing above.
    For Java's type <code>byte</code>, the bits 01111111 represent 127 but 10000000 is &minus;128.
    </p>
    <p>
    Adding these together as binary numbers in the usual way, we get 11111111,
    which represents &minus;1, just as we'd expect when we add &minus;128 and 127. Adding one more to this—and dropping the
    final carry—we have 00000000, the representation of 0, also as we would like. Some other representations of numbers as bytes are as follows:
    </p>
    <table class=rowlines >
    <tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Bits</th></tr>
    <tr><td>&minus;7</td><td><code>11111001</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&minus;4</td><td><code>11111100</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&minus;2</td><td><code>11111110</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&minus;1</td><td><code>11111111</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td><code>00000000</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td><code>00000001</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td><code>00000010</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td><code>00000100</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td><code>00000111</code></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    In effect, going from an unsigned representation to a two's-complement
    signed representation takes the upper half of the representable numbers and
    makes them wrap around to become negative numbers. This works because
    numeric computations are done modulo 2<sup>n</sup>, and 128 and &minus;128
    are the same number modulo 2<sup>8</sup>. By the properties of modular arithmetic,
    the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operators can be implemented
    exactly the same way for signed and unsigned numbers in the two's-complement
    representation.

    <p>Everything we have said about the <code>byte</code> applies to the other signed Java types (<code>short</code>,
    <code>int</code>, and <code>long</code>), except that those types have more bits (16, 32, and 64 respectively).
    </p>

    <p>An interesting identity is that to negate a number, you simply invert
    all of its bits and then add one, discarding any final carry. Considering
    bytes, we have &minus;1 = 11111110 + 1 = 11111111. What about negating 0? In
    this case, &minus;0 = 11111111 + 1 = 100000000, but this is just 0 once we
    discard the 9th digit.
    </p>

    <p>Other representations for numbers exist, such as one's-complement, in which
    the negation of a number is performed by inverting all of its bits. But
    the usual two's-component representation is more convenient to work with and
    leads to simpler, faster implementations in hardware. At this point
    essentially everyone uses two's complement.
    </p>

<h3>Bit-level operators</h3>

<p>We've seen that we can view an integral type like <code>int</code>   
as a sequence of bits. Java supports several operators on integral      
types that operate at the level of bits. For example, given a number    
<code>x</code>, the unary operation <code>~x</code> inverts all         
of the bits in the number. Perhaps surprisingly, this operator is       
closely related to negation. If <code>-x</code> is representable,       
then <code>-x</code> is equal to <code>~x + 1</code>.  We can see       
why this works by considering that we can also flip all the bits in     
<code>x</code> by subtracting it from -1, which, after all, is just a   
sequence of 1 bits. Therefore, <code>~x</code> = <code>-1 - x</code>.   
Adding 1 to both sides, we get <code>~x + 1</code> = <code>-x</code>.   
</p>                                                                    
<p>It is interesting to see how powers of two and negated powers of
two are represented. A power of two (say, 8) is all zeros except for
a single 1 digit: 00001000. To get the corresponding negative number,
we can flip all the bits and add one: 11110111 + 1 = 11111000. Thus,
a negated power of two looks just like the power of two except that
all of its leading digits are 1 instead of 0.
</p>
<p>Integral types also support bitwise "and" and "or" operations, written
<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>.  For example, <code>10 &amp; 6</code>
written in binary is <code>1010 &amp; 0110</code>. Taking the logical "and" of
each corresponding bit, we get <code>0010</code>, or 2. The logical "or" is
<code>1110</code>, so <code>10|6</code> = <code>14</code>. There is also a
bitwise "exclusive or" operation, written <code>^</code>. Exclusive or acts
like or but <code>1^1</code> = <code>0</code>.
</p>
<p>Java also supports shift operators that slide the bits of a number left or
right. The left shift operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code> moves the bits of number
left by the designated number of positions, shifting in <code>0</code> on
the right. For example, on the <code>byte</code> type we would have:
<pre>
    00000011 &lt;&lt; 1 = 00000110
    00000101 &lt;&lt; 3 = 00101000
    11111110 &lt;&lt; 2 = 11111000
</pre>
<p>
Notice that moving a bit leftward by one position doubles its value. Therefore,
as long as the two most significant bits are the same, shifting left by one bit
is the same as multiplying by two. If they are not the same, then the result
of multiplying by two would not be representable in that numeric type anyway.
Therefore, shifting left by one bit is exactly the same as multiplying by 2.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to <i>divide</i> by shifting <i>right</i>. The (arithmetic) right-shift
operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code> shifts all bits in a number to the right by
the specified number of positions. However, unlike the left-shift operator,
it does not change the most significant bit. By keeping the most significant
bit, it preserves the sign of the result and therefore inverts the effect of
<code>&lt;&lt;</code> when that operator would have successfully multiplied by 2.
</p>
<p>
There is also a <i>logical</i> right shift operator <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>,
which shift all bits to the right but changes the high bit to <code>0</code>.
On nonnegative numbers, shifting right by one bit still has the effect of
dividing by two, but its effect on negative numbers is not so easy (or useful) to interpret
arithmetically.
</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>When Java variables (both local variables and instance variables)
are stored in the computer's memory, they may
take up more space than the number of bits indicated.  In particular,
variables are stored in memory on word boundaries and always take up
an integral number of words. So variables with types
<code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>byte</code>, and
<code>char</code> all take up one full 32-bit word, whereas variables with
type <code>long</code> take up two consecutive words. For example,
given these variable declarations:
</p>

<pre>
char c = 'a';
long x = 1;
</pre>

<p>
We might find variables <code>c</code> and <code>x</code> stored in
consecutive memory locations 10012&ndash;10023 as in the following
figure showing the contents of each byte. Notice that the high 32 bits
of <code>x</code> are all zero, and that the high 16 bits of the word containing
<code>c</code> are unused and probably contain zeros.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<canvas id="vars" style="width: 260px; height: 140px"></canvas>
</div>
<script class=graphics type="application/javascript">
  with (new CFigure("vars")) {
    function byte(x) {
        const r = rectangle().setH(18).setW(22)
        if (x) r.addText(subscript(x))
        else r.setFillStyle("#ccc")
        return r
    }
    function word(b3, b2, b1, b0) {
        return group(byte(b3), byte(b2), byte(b1), byte(b0)).align("abut", "top bottom")
    }
    const row1 = word(null, null, "0", "97"),
          row2 = word("0", "0", "0", "1"),
          row3 = word("0", "0", "0", "0")
    align("left right", "abut", row1, row2, row3)
    const ll = vertLine(), rl = vertLine()
    align("none", "top bottom", ll, rl)
    align("left", "none", ll, row1)
    align("right", "none", rl, row1)
    equal(ll.y0(), minus(row1.y0(), 25), 2)
    equal(minus(ll.y1(), row3.y1()), minus(row1.y0(), ll.y0()))
    let c = label("c"), x = label("x"),
        a1 = label("10012"), a2 = label("10016"), a3 = label("10020")
    equal(c.x0(), canvasRect().x0())
    align("center", "none", c, x)
    align("distribute", "center", c, a1, row1)
    align("distribute", "center", x, a2, row2)
    align("distribute", "center", a3, row3)
    align("right", "none", a1, a2, a3)
  }
</script>

<p>Fields of objects (instance variables) are stored in the same way as
variables, taking up an integral number of words that are located contiguously
in memory. (By contrast to Java, languages like C and C++ try to pack fields
into memory more.) </p>

<h2>Objects and pointers</h2>

<p>
We have been drawing object diagrams that include pointers, which might have
been a little mysterious. However, the representation of pointers is quite
straightforward: a pointer is represented just like the (unsigned) number that is
the memory address of the memory location it points to. Since modern computers
have addresses up to 2<sup>64</sup>&minus;1, the representation of a pointer takes up
64 bits, or two 32-bit words.
</p>

<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
class A {
    char c;
    B y;
}
class B {
    long z;
}
...
B b = new B();
b.z = 1;
A a = new A();
a.c = 'a';
a.y = b;
</pre>
<p>Suppose that object b is located at memory location 14404 and
object a is located at 22288. Then memory looks something
like the following:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<canvas id="objects" style="width: 260px; height: 350px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics type="application/javascript">
  with (new CFigure("objects")) {
    function unused() { return rectangle().setStrokeStyle(null).setFillStyle("#bbb").setW(80) }
    let u, a, b, ao, bo

    align("right", "abut",
        u = unused().setH(20),
        b = varBoxes("b=14404", "=0"),
        unused().setH(10),
        a = varBoxes("a=22288", "=0"),
        unused().setH(15),
        bo = varBoxes("14404=B", "z  14408=1", "14412=0"),
        unused().setH(20),
        ao = varBoxes("22288=A", "c  22292=97", "y  22296=14404", ""),
        unused().setH(25)
    )
    equal(u.y0(), 2)
    let vl = vertLine(), vr = vertLine()
    align("left", "top", u, vl)
    align("right", "top", u, vr)
    align("none", "top bottom", vl, vr)
    equal(vl.y0(), 0)
    equal(vl.y1(), canvasRect().y1())
    pointer(b.getVar(0), bo.getVar(0).cr().toRight(50), bo.getVar(0).cr()).setLineDash([4, 4]).setStrokeStyle("#888").setFillStyle("#888")
    pointer(a.getVar(0), ao.getVar(0).cr().toRight(50), ao.getVar(0).cr()).setLineDash([4, 4]).setStrokeStyle("#888").setFillStyle("#888")
  }

</script>
</div>

<p>Notice that each object starts with one header word that describes its
class. This word actually contains a pointer to another memory location
that is shared by all objects of that class.</p>

<p>Because the actual memory addresses and the sizes of numbers and pointers
don't matter much, it is sufficient for understanding this program to look at the
simpler object diagrams we have been using:</p>

<div class="figure">
<canvas id="boxes-arrows" style="width: 260px; height: 170px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics type="application/javascript">
  with (new CFigure("boxes-arrows")) {
    let a = varBoxes("class=A", "c=97", "y=")
    let b = varBoxes("class=B", "z=1")
    equal(b.y0(), plus(a.y1(), 0))
    equal(plus(a.x1(), 50), b.x0())
    pointer(a.getVar(2), b.getVar(0).cl().toLeft(30), b.getVar(0).cl())
  }
</script>
</div>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>Unlike variables, array elements are usually stored in a more compact way in
memory in which no space is wasted. An array of characters
(a <code>char[]</code> value) is stored with the characters packed contiguously in
memory, with two characters per 32-bit word. Similarly, a <code>byte[]</code>
array is stored with each byte of the array taking up exactly one byte in
memory.
</p>
<p>
The exception is arrays of <code>boolean</code>, which are stored with one full
word per boolean value. It is therefore prudent to avoid the type
<code>boolean[]</code> for large arrays. The Java class
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/BitSet.html"><code>BitSet</code></a>
offers the functionality of an array of booleans (and more) but has a much more
compact representation for large arrays.
</p>

<h2>Garbage collection</h2>
<p>
Objects take up space in memory, so if the program allocates enough objects, the computer
could potentially run out of space to store objects in memory. To help with this problem,
Java has the feature of <strong>garbage collection</strong>. Objects that the Java runtime system
can figure out will never be used again are automatically garbage-collected and their space
is reclaimed for use by other objects. The runtime may also move objects around in memory
to create large contiguous chunks of memory.
</p>
<p>
How does the runtime system know which objects will never be used again? In
general, it can't know that precisely. As a safe approximation, an object is
considered to be <strong>garbage</strong> if the running program has no way to ever reach
the object again by following a chain of pointers.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, a program that unintentionally retains references to useless
objects can prevent them being reclaimed as garbage.  Usually, programmers do
not need to worry about this issue, but it can become a real problem in
long-running programs with complex data structures.
</p>
<h2>Floating point representations</h2>

<p>Java supports <strong>floating-point</strong> numbers that act a lot like real
numbers. But it would take an unbounded amount of memory to store a real
number, in general, so floating-point numbers are only an approximation to real
numbers. There are two floating-point types in Java. The type
<code>float</code> is a <strong>single-precision</strong> floating point number taking up
one word, and the type <code>double</code> is a <strong>double-precision</strong>
floating point number taking up two words.</p>

<p>Because floating point numbers have limited precision, computations using them
have limited accuracy. Numbers are internally represented in binary (base 2), so
even a number like 0.1 is represented in a way that is only accurate to about 7
digits of precision.
</p>

<p>It is possible to see how
floating point numbers are represented in Java by using the methods
<code>Float.floatToRawIntBits</code> and
<code>Double.doubleToRawLongBits(double)</code>, which return an
<code>int</code> and a <code>long</code> containing the same bits as the
respective <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>.
You can explore how floating point numbers are represented using
<a id="dumpFloat" href="src/dumpFloat.java">this Java program, <code>dumpFloat</code></a>.

<p>
According to the IEEE 754 specification, which is almost universally followed at this point,
a single-precision floating point number has the following representation:</p>

<div class="figure">
<canvas id=floating-point-rep style="height: 95px">
  <span aria-hidden="true">Single-precision floating-point representation</span>

<script class=graphics>

<p>A floating point number is represented using three components, the sign, the exponent, and the mantissa,
respectively taking up 1, 8, and 23 bits of the 32-bit word.
</p>
<p>
Given representation components \(s\) (sign), \(exp\) (exponent), and \(m\) (mantissa), where the exponent \(exp\) is between &minus;126 and 127,
the following real number is signified:
\[
(&minus;1)^s·2^{\mathit{exp}}·(1.m)
\]
<p>Here, we interpret m as a sequence of binary digits, so &ldquo;\(1.m\)&rdquo; represents a binary number that is at least 1 (and equal to 1 in the case where
m = "000000...") and less than 2. The largest number that \(1.m\) can represent is "1.11111...", which is a binary representation of a
number less than 2 by the small amount 2<sup>&minus;23</sup>.</p>
<p>
Thus, if we want to represent the number 1, we choose \(s=0\), \(exp=0\), and \(m=0000\dots\)
To represent numbers outside the interval [1,2), an exponent is needed. To
represent 2, we use \(s = 0\), exp = \(1\), \(m=0000\dots\), since \(1·2^1 = 2\).
To represent 3, we choose \(s=0\), \(exp=1\), \(m=10000\dots\), since
1.1 in base 2 represents 3/2, and 3/2·2<sup>1</sup> = 3. And so on.</p>
<p>The exponent is stored with a <strong>bias</strong> of 127; that is, the <strong>biased exponent</strong>
\(bexp\) equals \(exp + 127\).
The actual
bit-level representation of the number 1.0 has \(s = 0,\) \(bexp = 01111111\), and
\(m = 00000000000000000000000\), and the whole word contains exactly the 32 bits
\(00111111100000000000000000000000\).</p>

<p>Some special exponents follow different rules. If the exponent is \(&minus;127\)
(and hence the biased exponent is 0), the <strong>denormalized</strong> representation is used.
The represented number is instead:
:</p>
\[
(-1)^s·2^{-126}·(0.m)
\]

<p>Therefore, a word consisting entirely of 0's represents the        
floating-point number 0.0, since \(0.m = 0\) in that case.  It is         
also possible to represent the floating point number \(-0.0\),      
which behaves slightly differently, such as when its reciprocal is    
computed.
In the <strong>denormalized</strong> representation, some or many of the mantissa
bits are zero, so the relative precision of the number is reduced.</p>

<p>The largest number representable using <code>float</code> is
<code>Float.MAX_VALUE</code>, which is about 3.0·10<sup>38</sup>. And the smallest positive
number representable with full precision is about 10<sup>&minus;38</sup>. It is
possible to represent smaller numbers down to about 10<sup>&minus;45</sup>

<p>A biased exponent of 255 (all 1's in binary) is not used to represent
ordinary numbers. Instead, it is used to represent various other kinds of
values, such as  positive and negative infinity, which use a mantissa of 0 and      
the appropriate sign bit. If the mantissa is anything other than 0,   
the represented value is called NaN, for &ldquo;not    
a number&rdquo;.  The value NaN arises when there is no reasonable    
answer to the computation, such as when adding positive and negative  
infinity or when dividing zero by zero.  Any numeric computation performed
using NaN produces NaN, so a     final result of NaN indicates that something
went wrong during the    computation.</p>

<p>A single decimal digit corresponds to log<sub>2</sub> 10 = 3.32
binary digits, so the number of decimal digits represented by 23 mantissa bits
is 23/3.32 = 6.93.  You can therefore think of floating point numbers
as representing numbers to about 7 digits of precision. However, errors
tend to accumulate with each computation, so a long computation often has
fewer digits of precision. For example, if you subtract 1000000.0 from
1000000.1, the true result will be 0.1, but it is computed with only 1 digit of precision.
In fact, as <a href="#dumpFloat">the program linked above</a> shows,
the result is reported to be 0.125, a very large relative error of 25%. Oops!</p>

<p>Another thing to watch out for is that the order of operations may affect
what you compute, because rounding gets done at different places. Just because
two formulas produce the same real number in mathematics doesn't mean they will
produce the same floating-point number. Even an operation as simple as summing
a set of numbers can produce different results depending on the order in which
the numbers are added.  As a result, we have to be very careful about comparing
two floating-point numbers for equality. They will be equal if they were
produced by exactly the same computation, but otherwise round-off error will
make them differ somewhat. Rather than check for equality, often we instead
check that their difference lies within some <strong>tolerance</strong> corresponding to
the largest expected round-off error.
</p>

<p>Because single-precision floating point has limited precision, it is
usually better to use the more precise type <code>double</code>.
A double-precision number has 11 exponent bits with a bias of
1023 and 53 mantissa bits (52 explicitly stored), so it has about 16 decimal digits
of precision. The number represented with sign bit \(s\), biased exponent \(\mathit{bexp}\), and
52 mantissa bits \(m\) is:

\[
(&minus;1)^s·2^{\mathit{bexp}-1023}·(1.m)
\]

<p>
For most applications, that's plenty of precision and range, with base-10 exponents all the way from &minus;308 to 308. Neither <code>float</code> nor <code>double</code>
is actually the same thing as a real number in mathematics, but if you stick to <code>double</code>, you are much
less likely to get into trouble pretending that it is.

<h1>Design patterns</h1>
<p>
Design patterns are coding idioms that help build better programs. The goal is
often to help make programs more modular by decoupling communicating code
modules. Some design patterns just help avoid mistakes. Design patterns give
programmers a common vocabulary for explaining their designs and aid in quick
understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of particular designs.
</p>
<p>
The term <b>design pattern</b> was introduced by the very influential
&ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; book, <i>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
Object-Oriented Software,</i> by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and
John Vlissides. The book discusses object-oriented programming and identifies
more than 20 design patterns.</p>
<p>
Many other design patterns and variations thereof have been
identified since, some more useful and meaningful than others. In this lecture
we look at some of the more important ones to understand why they
are helpful. Understanding patterns will also help you resist the lure of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">Cargo Cult
Programming</a> <b>antipattern</b>, in which design patterns are used without real
purpose.
</p>

<h2>Option pattern</h2>
<p>
What do we do when a function has no reasonable return value for some arguments?
One possibility is to use a precondition simply to rule out such arguments, but
sometimes we will need to provide clients with a more flexible interface because it
is not reasonable to ask them to satisfy a precondition.  We can throw an exception,
preferably a checked one so that the compiler reminds us to handle the exceptional case.
Or we can return a special value. In practice, it is common for programmers to use
<code>null</code> as that special value. 
</p>
<p>
The problem with <code>null</code> is that the compiler gives us very little help
in reasoning about when it might appear. Every non-primitive type can take on the
value <code>null</code>, so it might be anywhere. And if the code tries to use
a null value as if it were a real object, a null-pointer exception (NPE) will ensue,
probably crashing the program. A large fraction of Java bugs manifest as null-pointer
exceptions, and it is often unclear even to experienced programmers whether any
given variable in a Java bugs might take on a null value under some circumstance.
</p>
<p>
The Option pattern offers an alternative to programming with <code>null</code>. The
idea is to wrap up possibly absent values in an object. The standard Java libraries
offer a parameterized class <code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> that realizes this pattern. We have also
made available a similar class
<a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/maybe">
<code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code></a> that has some advantages.
Both classes have the virtue that by using them, it is clear to anyone
reading the code that the absence of a value is a possibility to be considered.
</p>
<p>
Both <code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> either
contain a value of type <code>T</code> (that is, a value is “present”) or they
are empty.  To contain a value <code>v</code>, we can use
<code>Optional.of(v)</code> or <code>Maybe.some(v)</code>. To represent the
absence of a value, we can use <code>Optional.empty()</code> or
<code>Maybe.none()</code>.
</p>
<p>Both abstractions support a method <code>isPresent()</code>,
which returns <code>true</code> if a value is contained, and both support a method
<code>get()</code>, which returns the contained value, if any. In the case of
<code>Optional</code>, calling <code>get()</code> on an empty <code>Optional</code> causes
the unchecked exception <code>NoSuchElementException</code> to be thrown.
For <code>Maybe</code>, on the other hand, a <em>checked</em> exception
<code>NoMaybeValue</code> is thrown in this situation. Because the exception is
checked at compile time, the Java compiler reminds us to handle the exception, which
is helpful for avoiding bugs.
</p>
<p>
For example, a traditional linked list node would be implemented using <code>null</code>
to indicate that the node is the last in the list:
<pre class=load>
<a href="NodeNull.java">Node.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
By instead using <code>Maybe</code>,
we can indicate clearly that the next node in the list might be absent,
get compiler support for checking that we are handling absence
correctly, and type less overall:
<pre class=load>
<a href="NodeMaybe.java">NodeMaybe.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Two basic operations on both <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> are the following:
<ul><li>
<p> <code>boolean isPresent()</code></p>
<p>Returns whether this <code>Maybe</code> contains a value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>T get() throws NoMaybeValue</code></p>
<p>Returns the value contained in this <code>Maybe</code>, or throws an exception if
there is no contained value. The exception <code>NoMaybeValue</code> is a checked
exception, so using <code>get()</code> forces the programmer to handle the exception,
unlike with <code>Optional</code>, where an unchecked exception would be thrown.
The <code>NoMaybeValue</code> exception is also special in that it can be thrown
and caught faster than ordinary exceptions, though at the price of less debugging
information.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, suppose we possibly have a string and we want to print it if so. We
can use a <code>try...catch</code> statement as a conditional:
<pre class=load>
<a href="maybe_ex1.java">maybe_ex1.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Maybes and Optionals also support another mode of programming in which exceptions are not
used, typically relying on lambda expressions. The methods <code>then</code>, <code>orElse</code>, and
<code>orElseGet</code> can be used to express condition evaluation. For example, suppose that we may
have a string, and we want to put parentheses around it if we do; if we don't have a string, we want 
the empty string. The <code>then</code> method expresses the computation that should be done on a
maybe that holds a value, and the <code>orElse</code> method expresses computation on an empty Maybe.
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="maybe_ex2.java">maybe_ex2.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
This code looks like an if-then-else statement but we need to be a little careful. The argument to the
method <code>orElse</code> is evaluated even if that path is not taken. If we want to avoid evaluating
that expression, we can use <code>orElseGet()</code> to delay the computation. For example, if we wanted
to have a side effect when there is no string, we can put the side effect inside a lambda expression and use
<code>orElseGet()</code>:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="maybe_ex3.java">maybe_ex3.java</a>
</pre>
<p>Notice that this <code>return</code> statement only returns from the lambda expression.
</p>
<p><code>Optional</code> supports the same style of programming, but the
methods have somewhat less intuitive names; for example, the method
<code>then()</code> is named <code>map()</code>.  These less intuitive names
are chosen to make <code>Optional</code> compatible with Java Streams.

<h2>Iterator pattern</h2>
<p>
A common problem when designing programs is how to
set up a stream of information from a <b>producer</b> module A to a <b>consumer</b>
module B, while keeping both A and B decoupled so that each has no dependency
on the module they are communicating with. Assuming that the values communicated have some type
T, the communication we want can be depicted as follows:
</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="atob.png"/></div>

<p>The Iterator design pattern is one way to solve this programming problem. Module A
constructs objects that provide the ability for the consumer to &ldquo;pull&rdquo;
values from the producer. These object provide an interface like the following:
<pre class=load>
<a href="Iterator.java">Iterator.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
This is a polling-style interface, in which the consumer can ask any
time for a new object, but might have to wait until something is available.
The next object is retrieved from the Iterator by calling <code>next()</code>. To detect the
end of the iteration without using exceptions, it is standard to use the
<code>hasNext()</code> method.
</p>
<p>Once consumer B has obtained an iterator from producer A, it can
keep getting new elements from the iterator without mentioning A in any way.
The producer code doesn't need know about B, either. Thus, we have complete
decoupling of A and B.
</p>
<p>An additional advantage of this pattern is that multiple consumers can
obtain streams of information from a single producer without interfering with
each other. Whatever state is needed to keep track of the position in the
stream is stored in the iterator object, not in the producer.
</p>
<p>Java provides some convenient syntactic sugar for invoking iterators. A
statement of the form</p>
<pre>
for (T x : c) {
    // ...body...
}
</pre>
<p>is syntactic sugar for</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="foreach.java">foreach.java</a>
</pre>

<p>To use this syntactic sugar, it is necessary that <code>c</code> either be
an array or implement the interface <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>:
<pre class=load>
<a href="Iterable.java">Iterable.java</a>
</pre>

<h3>Implementing iterators</h3>

<p>Iterators are very handy and easy for client code to use. They are a welcome addition
to interfaces. However, there is one problem: implementing them can be tricky.
<ol>
<li><p>The iterator needs to keep track of the current state of the iteration so
that it can resume at the right place in the stream on each call to
<code>next()</code>. For tree data structures, tracking iteration state is particularly awkward.
The state of the iteration is a path from the root to the current node. This
path must be updated on each call to <code>next</code>.</p>
<li><p>The iterator supports both <code>hasNext()</code> and <code>next()</code>
methods. The <code>hasNext()</code> method must figure out whether there is a
next element to be provided. Typically, this duplicates work that the
<code>next()</code> might have to do, and in some cases, that work <em>cannot</em>
be done separately by the two methods. The iterator must contain additional state
to keep track of whether the current answer to <code>hasNext()</code> has been
computed yet.</p>
<li>
<p>Dealing with changes to the underlying data structure during
iteration is often tricky, so changes to the collection being iterated over is
typically forbidden. In the Java collections framework, collection
classes throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>
if an element is requested from an iterator after a mutation to the
collection that occurred during the iteration. Note that a concurrent
modification can happen even if there is no real concurrency in the
system. To detect such requests, every collection class object has a hidden
version number that is incremented after each mutation. Iterator objects
record the collection's version number when they are created, and
compare this version number against the collection's on each call to
<code>next()</code>. A mismatch causes the exception to be thrown.
</p>
<p>A commonly desired change to the collection is to remove the element
currently referenced by the iterator. Iterators may support a
<code>remove()</code> method whose job it is to remove the current element;
this operation is not considered a concurrent modification. However, 
if there are multiple iterators traversing the data structure, a 
<code>remove()</code> by one iterator will in general break
the others.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Generators</h3>
<p>
Some languages other than Java support another language construct that
makes it easier to implement iterators. The C#, Python, Ruby languages support
<b>generators</b> that send results to the consumer using the
<code>yield</code> statement. An extended version of Java that supports
<code>yield</code> is <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/jmatch">JMatch</a>, developed at Cornell. In these
languages, one can think of the iterator as running concurrently with the
consumer, but only when the consumer requests a new value. The iterator and
the loop body are <b>coroutines</b>. For example, with
generators, an iterator for trees can be implemented very easily using recursion:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="tree_iterator.java">tree_iterator.java</a>
</pre>
<p class=cont>
By contrast, a Java implementation of the same iterator will take at least 50 lines of
code and offer more opportunities for introducing bugs. On the other hand, a careful
Java implementation of a tree iterator can be made to run faster than the generator,
by avoiding <tt>yield</tt>ing elements up through every level of the tree. The trick
is to keep the path from the root to the current node in a stack.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, the term <b>iterator</b> originally referred to this style of
implementing iteration, which was invented in the language CLU in the 70's. The
term <b>generator</b> originally referred to what we now know as the iterator
design pattern.
</p>

<h2>Observer pattern</h2>
<p>
Sometimes we want to send a stream of information from a producer to a
consumer, but it's not convenient to have the consumer polling the producer.
Instead, we want to push information from the producer to the consumer. We can
think of the information being pushed as events that the consumer wants to know
about. This is the idea behind the Observer pattern, which works 
in the opposite way as the Iterator pattern:
<div class=figure>
<img src="iterator-observer.png"/>
</div>
<p>
In the Observer pattern, the consumer provides an object implementing the interface
<code>Observer&lt;T&gt;</code>:
<pre class=load>
<a href="Observer.java">Observer.java</a>
</pre>

<p>Whenever the producer has a new event <code>x</code> to report to the
consumer, it calls the observer's method <code>notify(x)</code>. The observer
then does something with the data it receives that is appropriate for the
consumer. Since the observer is provided by the consumer, it knows what
operations the consumer has and is typically inside the consumer's abstraction
boundary, perhaps implemented as an inner class.
</p>

<p>
How does the producer know which observers to notify? This is accomplished by
<b>registering</b> the observer(s) with the producer. The producer implements
an interface similar to this:
<pre class=load>
<a href="Observable.java">Observable.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
When the producer receives a call to <code>registerObserver</code>, it records
the observer in its collection of observers to be notified. When the producer
has a new event to provide to consumers, it iterates over the collection,
calling <code>notify</code> on each observer in the collection.
</p>
<p>
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) typically involve listeners that listen for keyboard and
mouse events and other events that change the appearance of the display. This is the case with JavaFX, which we will be using in our final project. Such listeners are an instance of the observer pattern.
For example, <code>ActionListeners</code> are observers with a
<code>notify</code> named <code>actionPerformed</code>. If one is setting 
up listener <code>l</code> for button clicks, the <code>Observable</code> in question
is the <code>JButton</code> object, and the listener is registered by
calling <code>addActionListener(l)</code>.
</p>
<p>
Like the Iterator pattern, the Observer pattern has the benefit that the
producer and consumer can exchange information without tying either
implementation to the other. The only information they share is the type
of events being listened for. An observable can also provide information to
multiple observers simultaneously.
</p>
<p>We can see that there is a symmetry to Iterators and Observers. We can
make this a bit more compelling. Using A → B to represent the type of a function
that takes in an A and returns a B, and using () to represent the type of an
empty argument list (which is really the same thing as <code>void</code>), we
have the following types:

<p><b>
Iterator:
</b></p>
<pre>
  next: () → T
  iterator: () → (() → T)
</pre>

<p><b>
Observer:
</b></p>
<pre>
  notify: T → ()
  registerObserver: (T → ()) → ()
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the types of the Iterator operations are exactly the same as the
types of the Observer operations, except that all the arrows are flipped to
point in the opposite direction! This shows that we have a <b>duality</b>
between Iterator and Observer.
</p>

<h2>Factory and Abstract Factory patterns</h2>

<p>When we create objects using a constructor, we tie the calling code to a particular choice of
implementation. For example, when creating a set, we specify exactly which implementation we are using
(for simplicity, let's ignore type parameters):
</p>
<pre>
  Set s = new HashSet();
</pre>
<p>One way to avoid binding the client code explicitly to an implementing class is to use
<b>factory methods</b>, which we have discussed earlier. We might declare a class with
static methods that create appropriate data structures:
<pre>
class DataStructs {
   static Set createSet() { return new HashSet(); }
   static Map createMap() { return new HashMap(); }
   static List createList() { return new LinkedList(); }
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Now the client can create sets without naming the implementation, and the choice of which implementations to
use for all the data structures has been centralized in the <code>DataStructs</code> class.
</p>
<p>Sometimes even static factory methods don't provide enough flexibility. The choice
of implementation is still fixed at compile time even if the client code doesn't choose it
explicitly. We can solve this problem by using the Abstract Factory pattern. The idea is
to define an interface with non-static creator methods for the various kinds of things that need to be
allocated.

<pre>
interface DataStructs {
   Set createSet();
   Map createMap();
   List createList();
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>All the choices about what implementation to use can now be bound into an object that
implements this interface. Assuming that object is in a variable <code>ds</code>, the client
might contain:
<pre>
DataStructs ds;
...
Set s = ds.createSet();
</pre>
<p>
Of course the choice of implementation has to be made somewhere, where
<code>ds</code> is initialized, but that can be far away from the uses of
<code>ds</code>, in some other module. Since the abstract factory is an object,
it can be chosen truly dynamically, at run time. There can even be multiple
implementations of an abstract factory interface used within the same program.
</p>
<p>
One place where the abstract factory approach has been used successfully is for
user interface libraries. We might define an interface for creating UI components:
<pre>
interface UIFactory {
   Button createButton(String label);
   Label createLabel(String txt);
   Scrollbar createScrollbar();
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>Then, different <code>UIFactory</code> objects can encapsulate different choices
of <b>look and feel</b> for the user interface, depending on the platform on which they
are running. This is why GUIs look different on Windows and Mac OS.
The implementation of each GUI component is chosen dynamically based on the
underlying OS platform to conform to the look and feel of the platform.
</p>

<h2>Builder pattern</h2>
<p>
The Builder pattern is another pattern for object construction. The motivation
for this pattern is that often we find ourselves wanting to construct complex
objects. Passing all the attributes of the object as part of a constructor
call can then lead to many parameters and clunky code that is hard to read.
The obvious alternative is to set the attributes of the object using setters,
but this approach is even worse, since it leads to a porous abstraction barrier
and mistakes result in incompletely initialized objects.
</p>
<p>
In the Builder pattern, the job of initialization is given to a another class
whose job it is to construct objects. The client passes all the information needed
to create the object through a series of method calls to the builder object. A
final call to the builder returns the newly constructed object. This works especially
well for creating immutable objects, which cannot be modified after creation.
It may be too awkward to provide the information needed to create the object
all at once, yet an immutable object should not have mutators. Instead, mutators
can be applied to the builder object, which then creates an immutable object.
</p>
The useful class <code>StringBuilder</code> is an example of this pattern. A
<code>StringBuilder</code> builds up a string through a series of <code>append</code>
calls, and a final call to <code>toString()</code> returns the finished string.
For long strings, it is much more efficient to construct the string this way than to
concatenate many short strings.
</p>
<p>
Here is a more interesting example of the Builder pattern,
in which an <code>EmployeeBuilder</code> class makes it
easy to build up an <code>Employee</code> object through a series of cascaded
method calls.
</p>
<pre class=load><a href="builder.java">builder.java</a></pre>
<p>
A builder class is designed to construct objects of some particular type; it may
choose dynamically which particular class to create based on the arguments it is
passed, further decoupling the client from the implementing class.
</p>

<h2>Singleton pattern</h2>

<p>Sometimes classes never need to have more than one instance. A class with
just one instance is an example of the Singleton pattern. For example, if we
wanted a class that represented empty linked lists, we might only allocate a
single object of that class, since all empty lists are interchangeable anyway.
We can expose it to clients via a public getter, and
hide the constructor since it shouldn't be used outside the class itself:
</p>
<pre>
class EmptyList implements List {
   private static EmptyList empty = new EmptyList();
   private EmptyList() {}
   public List empty() { return empty; }
}
</pre>

<p>
The Singleton pattern is also frequently used with the Abstract Factory pattern. 
There is no need to have more than one object of the class implementing, say, 
<code>DataStructs</code> or <code>UIFactory</code> in the examples above.
</p>

<h2>Composite</h2>

<p>The Composite pattern is a pattern that we've already been using: it refers to
using a data structure of objects to provide what appears to the client to be
a single object. This idea is simply the combination of data structures with
data abstraction. Even common objects like strings are Composite objects in Java.
</p>

<!-- h2>Flyweight</h2>

<p>The idea of this design pattern is to have objects that take up very little
memory. This is done by having their representations be small and also by placing
as much state as possible in underlying objects that are shared across many instances.
</p -->

<h2>Interning</h2>

<p>A related idea to flyweight objects is <b>interning</b> (known in Lisp as
<b>hashconsing</b>). A hash table is used to keep track of all objects of a
given class. Object creation is done by a factory method. When a new object is
requested to be created, the factory method uses the parameters to the calls to
look up whether a suitable object has already been created. If so, this object
is returned. Otherwise, a new object is created using the constructor, which is
typically made private so the only way to create objects is to go through the
factory method. This pattern makes the most sense for immutable abstractions,
because it may cause the same objects to be shared across unrelated code or
data structures.
</p>

<h2>Adapter</h2>

<p>The Adapter pattern allows an existing object to satisfy an interface it was
not originally designed to satisfy, hiding the actual interface provided by the
existing object. This is accomplished by using a wrapper object that implements
the interface and that simply redirects calls of the new interface to the appropriate
calls on the underlying wrapped object.
</p>

<h2>Decorator</h2>

<p>The Decorator pattern is similar to the Adapter pattern. Here the idea is to
extend the interface of some existing objects of a class. Unlike in the Adapter
pattern, the Decorator interface is a <em>subtype</em> of the interface that
the objects already implement; its implementation is a wrapper class that
redirects all calls from the original interface to the wrapped object.
</p>

<h2>External state</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is undesirable to record some of the state associated with an
object in the object itself, perhaps because the class cannot be extended with
new instance variables, because only some of the objects of the class have that
extra state, or because that state is involved in an invariant maintained by
another module. A second class is defined to contain that external state, and
objects of the second class are created as necessary. To allow quickly finding
the external state for an object, the external state objects are put into a
hash table, using the original object itself as a key to find the state.
</p>

<h2>Visitor</h2>
<p>
The Visitor pattern is an important pattern that allows the traversal of a tree
data structure (such as an abstract syntax tree) to be factored out from the
nodes of the tree in a generic way that can be reused for multiple traversals.
There are many variations on the visitor pattern.
</p>
<p>
Generally when building programs that manipulate abstract syntax tree, such as
compilers and interpreters, there is a need for multiple traversals over the
abstract syntax tree. For example, a compiler might use AST traversals to
perform not only type checking but also other transformations of the AST such
as constant folding or translation to a lower-level programming language closer
to executable code.
</p>
<p>
There are two natural ways to organize the code for a set of traversals: as an
individual module per traversal or as an individual module per AST type.
Object-oriented languages encourage structuring code around types. This structure
has the advantage that it is easy to add new types in a modular way, but adding
a new traversal involves modifying all of the node types. In procedural and functional
languages, it is more natural to structure the code as a set of functions, one per
traversal. With this structure, new traversals can be added in a modular way, but
adding a new type of nodes to the AST requires modifying all the traversal functions
so each knows how to handle the new type.
</p>
<!--
<p>
This tension between organizing code in terms of types versus in terms of
shared operations over those types was first identified clearly by John
Reynolds and later dubbed the “Expression Problem” by Phil Wadler.
</p>
-->
<p>
The Visitor pattern provides a structure to help manage this tension.
There are a number of variation on the Visitor pattern, but the common
idea is that operations are expressed as subclasses of a common Visitor
class. In the classic Visitor pattern, the Visitor class (and its subclasses)
have one method for each possible type. The base Visitor class supplies
default behavior for the various types, which may be to do nothing or
to perform some default traversal of child nodes. Subclasses of Visitor
can then override that behavior if desired.
</p>
<pre class="load"><a href="Visitor.java">Visitor.java</a>
</pre>
<p>The classes on which visitors operate supply a method <code>accept(v)</code>
method that invokes the appropriate visitor operation:
</p>
<pre class="load"><a href="Node.java">Node.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
One variation on the Visitor pattern that is useful for traversing
ASTs is to allow the node types to supply the boilerplate traversal
code. For example, the Node class might provide a method <code>visitChildren()</code>
that invokes <code>k.accept(v)</code> on each child node <code>k</code>.
This refinement allows the boilerplate traversal code to be written just
once and reused to implement multiple traversals.
</p>

<h2>State machine</h2>
<p>
Programming in an event-driven style can result in messy designs in which not
all events are handled. One way to ensure all events are handled is to
think about the program, or about parts of the program, as <b>state
machines</b>. Often state machines are presented as mathematical abstractions,
but they are also a way to organize code: a design pattern called the
<b>state design pattern</b>.
</p>
<p>A state machine has a set of states and a set of events that can occur. At any given
moment, the machine is in one of the allowed states. However, when it receives a new
event, it can change states. For each state and event, there is a new state to which
the machine transitions when that event is received in that state.
When the number of states is finite, the state machine is sometimes
called a <b>finite-state automaton</b>.</p>

<p>As a simple example, consider a window in a graphical user interface.
Simplifying a bit, it might be in one of the following states: (opened, closed, fullscreen, minimized).
Windows can also have a size and position, but let's ignore that for now. The following events can be received:
open, close, minimize, and maximize, corresponding to buttons that can be clicked.</p>

<p>A state machine can be represented as a graph in which the nodes are the states
and the edges are the transitions between states. The edges are labeled with the event
that causes that transition.</p>

<div class=figure>
<canvas id=state_machine style="width:400px; height:250px">
</div>
<script class=graphics type="application/javascript">
with (new CFigure("state_machine")) {
    function node() {
        return ellipse().setW(90).setH(60)
    }
    const opened = node().addText("opened"),
          closed = node().addText("closed"),
          fullscreen = node().addText("fullscreen"),
          minimized = node().addText("minimized")
    align("none", "center", opened, fullscreen)
    align("none", "center", closed, minimized)
    align("center", "none", opened, minimized)
    align("center", "none", fullscreen, closed)
    align("none", "top", opened, margin())
    align("right", "bottom", closed, margin())
    align("left", "top", opened.ul().toLeft(20), margin())

    connector(opened, average(opened, fullscreen).toTop(15), fullscreen).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("maximize", 0.5, 5));
    connector(fullscreen, average(opened, fullscreen).toBottom(15), opened).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("maximize", 0.5, 5));
    connector(opened, average(opened, minimized).toLeft(20), minimized).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("minimize", 0.2, -29));
    connector(fullscreen, closed).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("close", 0.5, 20));
    connector(minimized, average(opened, minimized).toRight(20), opened).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("open", 0.5, -25));
    connector(opened, closed).setEndArrow("arrow").addLabel(lineLabel("close", 0.5, -20));
}
</script>

<!-- p>
As a graph, the window implements the following state machine:
</p>

<p>A diagram like this helps understand what states the system can get into and
how the system moves among states. It doesn't help as much with ensuring that all
combinations of states and events are considered.
</p -->

<p>Alternatively, we can specify its behavior by giving a <b>state transition table</b>.
The rows of the table correspond to states, and the columns correspond to events. The entries in
the table say what the next state is, given the current state and event.
</p>

<div class=figure>
<table>
<tr> <th>State     <th>open<th>close<th>minimize<th>maximize</tr>
<tr> <th>1. opened      <td> — <td> 2 <td> 4 <td> 3 </tr>
<tr> <th>2. closed      <td> — <td> — <td> — <td> — </tr>
<tr> <th>3. fullscreen  <td> — <td> 2 <td> 4 <td> — </tr>
<tr> <th>4. minimized   <td> 1 <td> — <td> — <td> — </tr>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> The table helps us think systematically about all the possible things that
can happen in the system and be sure we have covered all the
possibilities. Thinking about the various entries helps us discover missing
event handlers and missing states. For example, when minimizing a
maximized window, the state machine above forgets that the window was
maximized. When the window is closed and reopened, it will still be minimized. If that
is not the desired behavior, we may need to add more states to the state machine.
</p>
<p>
The entries marked with &mdash; represent events that don't make
sense in the current state or would not have any effect.
These are interesting to think about because sometimes we need to
make sure that the user interface doesn't permit those events to
happen&mdash;perhaps by graying out the corresponding UI component. 
</p>
<p>
In the state design pattern, the various events that can be received by the
state machine are represented as different methods on the state machine object.
Each method captures one column of the state transition table. This design
systematically organizes the code that implements a state machine. The
following code suggests how our window example might look in this style.

<h2>Model-View-Controller</h2>
<p>
Since the GUI components are used to manipulate the information managed by the
application, it is tempting to store that information and the algorithms that
manipulate it (the <b>application logic</b>) directly in components, perhaps by
using inheritance. This is usually a bad idea. The code for graphical
presentation of information is different from the underlying operations on that
information. Interleaving them makes the code harder to understand and
maintain. Moreover, it makes it difficult to port the application to a new platform.
For example, you might implement the application in JavaFX and then want to port it
to Android, whose GUI toolkit is very different. So it is a good idea to keep
GUI code and the application logic separate.
</p>
<p>
This observation leads to the <b>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</b> pattern, in which the application
classes are separated into one of three categories: the <b>model</b>, which contains
the important application state and operations, and does not refer to the GUI
classes; the <b>view</b>, which provides a graphical view of the model; and the
<b>controller</b>, which handles user input and translates it into either changes to the view or
commands to be performed on the model.

</div>
<p>
The idea is that the view may hold some state, but only state related to how
the model is currently being displayed, or what part of the model is displayed.
If the view were destroyed, some version of it could be created anew from the model.
With this kind of structure, there can be more than one user interface built on top
of the same model. We can even have multiple coexisting views.
</p>
<p>
One of the challenges of the MVC pattern is how to allow the view to update
when the model changes without making the model depend on the view. This task
is usually accomplished using the Observer pattern. The model allows
observers to be registered on its state; the view is then notified when the
state changes.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<img src="mvc-flows.png"/>
</div>
<p>
This separation between model, view, and controller will be very important for
Assignment 7, in which you will build a distributed version of the critter
simulation. The model will run on a shared server with one or more clients
viewing that model through a user interface.
</p>
<p>There are many variations of the MVC pattern. Some versions of the MVC
pattern make less of a distinction between the view and the controller; this
is usually indicated by talking about the M/VC pattern, in which the view and the
controller are more tightly coupled, but strong separation is maintained between
the model and these two parts of the design.

<h2>Antipatterns</h2>
<p>
There are also coding patterns that are used frequently, but are best avoided. These
are often dubbed &ldquo;antipatterns&rdquo;. For example, some Java programmers make heavy use
of reflection in Java. Using reflection is generally bad practice, leading to slow, fragile
code. A <em>good</em> reason to use reflection is if you are loading code dynamically
at run time (for example, for plugins or for dynamic code generation). Most applications do
not need this capability, so we will not talk much about reflection in this course.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">good and rather humorous list of antipatterns</a>
can be found on Wikipedia.

<h1>Graphical User Interfaces: Display and Layout</h1>
<p>
One of the driving forces behind the development of object-oriented programming
was the need to create <strong>graphical user interfaces</strong> (GUIs). It is not surprising,
then, that the OO programming model really shines when building GUIs.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the standard WIMP model of graphical user interfaces (Windows, Icons,
Menus, Pointer) was developed at Xerox PARC during the 1970's in and along with
one of the first object-oriented programming languages, Smalltalk. GUIs
influenced the language design and vice versa. The WIMP model first saw
widespread deployment by Apple with the first Macintosh computer and was
soon adopted by Microsoft Windows as well.
</p>
<p>
In this approach to graphical user interface design, the user interface is
represented internally as a tree structure, in which the various user interface
components (sometimes called widgets) are nodes in the tree, and the parentâ€“child
relationship corresponds to containment. In fact, the HTML markup language
follows this same approach to defining a user interface.
</p>
<p>
We will be using JavaFX, a modern object-oriented GUI library. In such a library,
there are <em>two</em> interacting hierarchies: first, the containment hierarchy
corresponding to the tree of UI components, and second, the class hierarchy
of the components themselves. Unlike in HTML, the class hierarchy is extensible,
allowing developers to use inheritance to design new components or to customize
the behavior of existing components.
</p>
<h2>Scene Graph</h2>
<p>
JavaFX manages the user interface as a <b>scene graph</b>, which is actually a
tree of nodes. At the root of the scene graph is some node; the node is 
registered with a <tt>Scene</tt> object that is in turn registered with a
<tt>Stage</tt>, which corresponds to a top-level window in the application.
</p>
<h2>Node class hierarchy</h2>
<p>
JavaFX provides a rich class hierarchy of node types that can appear in the Scene
Graph. Some of them provide rendering capability, others are useful for layout, and
some are useful user interface devices such as buttons or text editors.
</p>

          </ul>
      </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>HBox
        <li>VBox
        <li>StackPane

<h2>Building a GUI</h2>
<p>
A scene graph must be constructed. This can be done either by either</p>
<ul class=bullets>
<li>writing code to build the scene graph one node at a time, or</li>
<li>reading it from a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the non-leaf nodes in the
tree are a subclass of <code>Parent</code> (typically a subclass of <code>Pane</code>).
</p>
<p>
To add a child using code:
</p>
<pre>
Parent p;
Node n;
p.getChildren().add(n);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>getChildren()</code> method returns a collection of children that is
tied to the actual children of the parent node. Thus, adding a new node to the
collection causes the parent node to acquire a new child. The collection can
be used in various other ways, however; for example, it can be used to
iterate over the children or to listen to its contents to find out when the set
of children changes.
</p>
<p>
A scene graph can also be created in advance using the <a
href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">
JavaFX Scene Builder application</a>. Scene Builder saves the scene is saved in
XML format in an <tt>.fxml</tt> file, which can be loaded by the application to
create the entire scene graph at once.
</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>
Some JavaFX nodes just display themselves (e.g., <code>Rectangle</code>). Some nodes do something active
(e.g., <code>Button</code>, <code>TextField</code>). Other nodes are just there to control the layout of other
nodes in the window. Examples of these are the various subclasses of <code>Pane</code>.
<code>Pane</code> places
all its children in the upper left corner, but its subclasses override this layout behavior in various
ways.
</p>
<p>For example, the classes <code>HBox</code> and <code>VBox</code>
lay out their children in a horizontal row or vertical column, respectively. <code>StackPane</code>
stacks all its children on top of each other in the center. <code>GridPane</code> organizes its
children into a regular grid, like an HTML table. <code>FlowPane</code> lays out its children like
words of text, in a series of top-to-bottom rows in which each row contains children laid out left-to-right. <code>BorderPane</code> expects to have five children; one is placed in the center and the four others
are placed at the top, bottom, right, and left.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>There are several ways to control the appearance of the scene. Some nodes have handles that
allow them to be minimized, maximized, or resized. There are also various controls such as
sliders or knobs to control shape, size, color, or other aspect of the appearance. Nodes can also be
added, removed, moved, or transformed. With JavaFX, when such a change is made and the
scene needs to be redrawn, the visible components of the scene redraw themselves in the right order.</p>

<p>
A useful feature of JavaFX is that nodes can be styled using style sheets (CSS), similar to how HTML
pages are styled (e.g., <code>p.setStyle("-fx-background-color: #ffff00");</code>). The style sheet
can also be created in advance and loaded from an external file. Style sheets provide an easy way to
rapidly experiment with different looks for an application without recompiling the application.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to draw onto a <code>Canvas</code> using a
<code>GraphicsContext</code> object.  One can draw shapes such as rectangles,
circles, ellipses, or curves. Canvases give complete control over rendering
anything within their borders, but the program has the responsibility for the
rendering. One difference from  Swing, JavaFX's predecessor, is that 
exposed pixels are redrawn automatically.</p>

<h2>Event-driven programs</h2>

<p>
JavaFX applications are typically <strong>event driven</strong>. This is a somewhat different
programming paradigm from the usual imperative style. Its motto is: "Don't call us, we'll call you."
When some hardware event takes place such as a mouse click or key press, an <code>Event</code>
object is generated. An <code>Event</code> object is simply a Java object like any other
Java object. It contains information about the source and type of the event: button click,
mouse movement, keystroke, etc. The event handler of any listener that has registered to
receive the event is called, and the event object is passed to the handler.
In that way an application can receive and respond to events such as
mouse clicks and button pushes.</p>

<h2>Threads</h2>
<p>
Unlike simple Java programs, a JavaFX application typically has multiple concurrent threads:
a <strong>main thread</strong>, a <strong>application thread</strong>, and a <strong>rendering thread</strong>, as well as various background worker threads, depending on the application. The application thread's sole task
is to loop continuously, listening for the occurrence of hardware-generated events such as mouse
clicks. For each such occurrence, it constructs an <code>Event</code> object describing the
event and the GUI component in which it occurred, then calls the event handler of each registered
listener with that <code>Event</code> object. The rendering thread's task is to continuously rerender the display.
</p>
<p>
Event handlers should not contain long-running computations, because this will
tie up the application thread, preventing events from being handled. While the
application thread is carrying out a long-running computation, the user
interface will freeze and not respond to events. 
Fortunately, there is a mechanism for scheduling an update of the GUI on the application
thread later using the method <tt>Platform.runLater(Runnable r)</tt>. The <code>run()</code>
method of the <code>Runnable</code> object <code>r</code> is called at the earliest available opportunity by the application thread.
</p>
<p>
Programming with threads is hard because they share access to the same objects. If two
threads access the same object, it is challenging to prevent them from <strong>interfering</strong>.
If one thread is in the middle of modifying an object while another thread accesses the object,
it is easy for the observing thread to see the object in a state in which its class invariant does
not hold. A good programming pattern for preventing interference is to have most objects <strong>owned</strong>
by a single thread. Accesses (either reading or writing) to an object by a thread that does not own 
the object are unsafe and are not permitted by the pattern.
</p>
<p>
The JavaFX scene graph follows this pattern. The scene graph is owned by the
JavaFX application thread.  If you create a background thread to do more
time-consuming computations, it may be tempting to have the background thread
access the nodes in the scene graph.  Such accesses are not allowed. JavaFX provides
other mechanisms for background threads to communicate with the application thread,
notably the method <code>Platform.runLater()</code>.

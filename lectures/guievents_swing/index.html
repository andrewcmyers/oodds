<h1>Graphical User Interfaces: Events and Animation</h1>

<h2>Handling events</h2>
<p>
Programs can define <strong>event handlers</strong> to handle different types
of input events. Handlers must be registered to receive events with a GUI
component on which the event can occur. There are several ways to specify a
handler: classes, inner classes, or lambda expressions. All are basically
syntactic sugar for the same thing, but convenient. Here is an example with a
lambda expression:
<pre>
JButton b = ...;
b.addActionListener(e -&gt; print("button clicked"));
</pre>
<p>
This code uses the Observer pattern.
Lambda expressions are really just syntactic sugar
for <b>inner classes</b>, which are anonymous classes implementing a specified
interface. In this case, the method <code>addActionListener</code> expects to
receive an object implementing the interface <code>ActionListener</code>:
</p>
<pre class="load">
<a href="ActionListener.java">ActionListener.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
It is not necessary to use a lambda expression to implement an event handler. The
lambda expression is syntactic sugar for the following code defining an inner class:
<pre class="load">
<a href="desugared_lambda.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
It is not even necessary to use an inner class; an ordinary class can be used to
implement the desired interface, as in the following code:
<pre class="load">
<a href="desugared_top_level_class.java">desugared_lambda.java</a>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In fact, even inner classes are syntactic sugar for top-level classes. Because
they are just syntactic sugar, they come with some limitations. In particular,
inner classes and lambda expressions can only refer to variables defined
outside their scope if those variables are final. The reason for this
limitation is that their objects may outlive the external variables they refer
to. For that reason, the implementation of inner classes and lambdas actually
makes a copy of any such external variable. Since the variable is final, there
is no way for the programmer to tell that such a copy has been made!

<h3>Using background threads with Swing</h3>
<p>
In Swing, any background work should be done not by the event dispatch thread,
but rather in a separate thread. If the event dispatch thread is busy doing work
instead of handling user interface events, the UI becomes unresponsive.
However, UI components are not thread-safe, so only the event dispatch thread may
access the component hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html">
<code>SwingWorker</code></a> class provides useful functionality for
starting up background threads and for obtaining results from them.
This is easier than coding up your own mechanism using locks and
condition variables. The key methods are these:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="SwingWorker.java">SwingWorker.java</a>
</pre>
<p>
Some of the methods are designed to be used within the implementation of
the task, and others are designed to be used by client code in other threads,
to control the task and to interact with it.
</p>
<p>
To compute something of type <code>T</code> in the background, a subclass of
<code>SwingWorker&lt;T, V&gt;</code> is defined that overrides the method
<code>doInBackground()</code>.
The work done by the task is defined by the <code>doInBackground()</code> method;
it should simply return the desired result at the end of the method in the
usual way. Notice that the <code>doInBackground()</code> method is not supposed to be
called by clients or by any subclass code; instead, it is automatically
called by the task thread.
</p>
<p>
To report progress back to other threads;
the worker thread may call <code>setProgress()</code>; they can observe the
progress report by calling <code>getProgress()</code>.
When the task completes by returning
a value of type <code>T</code> from the <code>doInBackground()</code> method,
the <code>done()</code> method is invoked by the event dispatch thread.
</p>
<p>
It is possible for a task to be canceled by calling the <code>cancel()</code> method;
however, it is incumbent on the implementation of the task to periodically check
whether the task has been canceled by using the <code>isCancelled()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
By calling <code>getProgress()</code>, client code in
the event dispatch thread can keep track of the progress of the task and update
the GUI to reflect how far along the task is. The SwingWorker can also communicate
back to the event dispatch thread by using method
<code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater()</code>, but this approach may couple the task
implementation with the GUI more than is desirable.

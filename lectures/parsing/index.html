<h1>Grammars and Parsing</h1>
<p>
Parsing is something we do constantly. In fact, you are doing it right
now as you read this sentence. Parsing is the process of converting a
stream of input into a structured representation. The input stream may
consists of words, characters, or even bits. The output of the process
is a tree.
</p>
<p>          
Our brains are remarkably good at parsing. When we hear a sentence like
“The rat ate cheese,” our brains build a <strong>parse tree</strong> similar to the
following diagram:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id="simple-sentence" style="width: 350px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("simple-sentence")) {
    setFontStyle("italic")
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        if (v == null) return point()
        if (v[0] == "*") return f.label(v.substring(1)).setFontStyle("bold")
        return f.label(v)
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(null, "sentence", [ "noun phrase", ["article", "*the"], ["noun", "*rat" ]],
                                     [ "verb phrase", ["verb", "*ate"] ],
                                     [ "noun phrase", ["noun", "*cheese"]]
                                     )
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin(25))
}
</script>
</div>
<p>The parse tree describes the structure of the sentence. Notice that the
leaves of the tree, in left-to-right order, spell out the sentence, but there
are also some other nodes higher up in the tree describing the grammatical
function of each word and of subsequences of words.</p>
<p>
Your brain can handle much more complex sentences, though it does
have its limits.  On the other hand, when you read a supposed sentence
like “rat cheese the ate the,” you instantly recognize this as not being
a sentence at all. This sequence of words
is a <strong>syntax error</strong>, because it has no parse tree. 

</p>
<p>
Parsing is performed by computers as well. Java programs are parsed
by the Java compiler. Even more mundane devices such as calculators
use parsing to interpret mathematical expressions. Parsing complex input
is a common need in computing systems, so it is important to know how to do it
well.
</p>
<h2>Grammars</h2>
<p>
For programming languages, legal syntax is defined by a <strong>grammar</strong>,
which specifies which input sequences have a parse tree.  While the
situation in real human languages is more complex, for programming
languages, legal syntax is defined using a <strong>context-free grammar</strong>.
The modifier <strong>context-free</strong> means that the legal syntax for a
subtree of the parse tree (say, the possible subtrees of a “noun phrase”
node, above) depends only on the node at the root of the subtree and not
on the rest of the tree. 
</p>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
<p>
The grammar is defined in terms of <strong>symbols</strong>.  There are two kinds of symbols:
<strong>terminal symbols</strong> (also
called <strong>tokens</strong> or just <strong>terminals</strong>) and <strong>nonterminal symbols</strong>
(or just <strong>nonterminals</strong>). The terminal symbols
can appear as part of the input (e.g., “rat”) and appear in the parse
tree only at its leaves. The nonterminal symbols (e.g., “noun phrase”)
appear at all other nodes in the tree.
</p>
<p>
There is usually a low-level preprocessing step called <strong>tokenization</strong>,
<strong>scanning</strong>, or <strong>lexing</strong>,
which reads a raw input stream (often a stream of bytes or characters)
and organizes that data into a sequence of tokens
to be presented to the parser. For example, when parsing the arithmetic expression
<code>(42 + foo) * 2112</code>, a tokenizer might break the input up into a
sequence of tokens: <code>(</code>, <code>42</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>foo</code>, <code>)</code>,
<code>*</code>, and <code>2112</code>.
</p>
<p>
<p>
One of the nonterminal symbols is the <strong>start symbol</strong>.  The root of the parse tree is always
the start symbol, although the start symbol may also occur elsewhere in the tree.
</p>
<h3>Productions</h3>
<p>
A context-free grammar also includes a set of <strong>productions</strong>,
which are rules that define how a single nonterminal can be expanded out into a
longer series of symbols. A given nonterminal can have multiple different
productions specifying alternative ways to expand it. For example, we can write
a pseudo-English grammar corresponding to the parse tree above:
</p>
<pre>
<i>sentence</i> → <i>noun-phrase verb-phrase noun-phrase</i>
<i>sentence</i> → <i>noun-phrase verb-phrase</i>
<i>noun-phrase</i> → <i>noun</i>
<i>noun-phrase</i> → <i>article</i> <i>noun</i>
<i>noun</i> → <i>adjective</i> <i>noun</i>
<i>article</i> → <b>the</b> | <b>a</b> | <b>an</b>
<i>adjective</i> → <b>young</b> | <b>old</b> | <b>red</b> | ...
<i>noun</i> → <b>cat</b> | <b>dog</b> | <b>rat</b> | <b>cheese</b> | ...
<i>verb</i> → <b>eats</b> | <b>barks</b> | ...
</pre>
<p>
As an abbreviation, when a single nonterminal has multiple productions,
we can write them all together on the right side separated by a vertical
bar. For example, the two productions for the nonterminal <i>noun-phrase</i>
could have been expressed more concisely:
<code><i>noun-phrase</i> → <i>noun</i> | <i>article</i> <i>noun</i></code>.
This notation is just an abbreviation for writing out multiple productions
in full.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>language</strong> of a grammar is the set of strings of terminal
symbols that can be produced by constructing a parse tree with that grammar.
Each such string strings is said to be <strong>derived</strong> from the start
symbol using the productions of the grammar. The job of a parser is to figure
out whether an input string is part of the language of the grammar and to
construct a parse tree if so.
</p>
<p>The language of a grammar can be infinite in size if the grammar is
<strong>recursive</strong>. For example, the productions <i>noun-phrase → article
noun</i> and <i>noun → adjective
noun</i> allow us to derive the following noun phrases:
“the dog”, “the old dog”, “the old old dog”, “the old old old dog”, and so on ad infinitum.
</p>
<h2>Ambiguity</h2>
<p>
With some grammars, it is possible for a string to have more than one parse
tree. Such a grammar is said to be <strong>ambiguous</strong>.
</p>
<p>
An example of an ambiguous grammar is the following grammar for arithmetic expressions,
with a single nonterminal symbol <i>E</i> and four productions:
</p>
<pre>
<i>E</i> → <b>n</b> | <i>E</i> + <i>E</i> | <i>E</i> × <i>E</i> | ( <i>E</i> )
</pre>
<p>
The symbols <b>n</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>×</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b> are all
terminals, where
the symbol <b>n</b> stands for all possible numeric literals: 1, 2, 3, etc.
</p>
<p>
With this grammar, a string like “<code>2 + 3 × 5</code>” has two possible parse trees, as shown:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id="two-parses" style="height: 170px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("two-parses")) {
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        if (v[0] == "*") return f.label(v.substring(1)).setFontStyle("bold")
        return f.label(v).setFontStyle("italic")
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t1 = tree(null, "E", ["E", "*2"], "*+", ["E", ["E", "*3"], "*×", ["E", "*5"]])
    const t2 = tree(null, "E", ["E", ["E", "*2"], "*+", ["E", "*3"]], "*×", ["E", "*5"])
    align("L", "TB", t1, margin(25))
    align("R", "TB", t2, margin(25))
    align("abut", "TB", t1, hspace(40), t2)
    equal(t1.w(), t2.w())
}
</script>
<p class="caption">
Two parse trees for “<code>2+3×5</code>”
</p>
</div>
<p>
Only one of these parse trees corresponds to our usual understanding of the
meaning of the expression as arithmetic: the one on the left.
The problem with the parse tree on the right is that it violates our
expectations about <strong>precedence</strong>. By convention, multiplicative operations
have higher precedence than additive operations, but the parse tree on the
right violates this custom, because the addition is performed first.
</p>

<p>
Usually, we
want the grammars we write to be unambiguous so that we obtain a unique parse
tree corresponding to the meaning of the expression. Unfortunately, there is
no algorithm that can determine in general whether a given grammar is ambiguous
(the problem is said to be <strong>undecidable</strong>). However,
in practice it is possible to design grammars in a way that avoids ambiguity.
</p>

<p>To remove the ambiguity and obtain the expected precedence, the
grammar can be rewritten to use more nonterminals. We add more nonterminals
to prevent a “+” production from appearing directly under a “×” production.
Here <i>T</i> represents an operand in an additive expression and
<i>F</i> represents an operand in a multiplicative expression.
The productions in this grammar prevent a <i>T</i> from appearing under an <i>F</i> in the
parse tree unless shielded by parentheses:
</p>
<pre>
<i>E</i> → <i>E</i> + <i>T</i> | <i>T</i>
<i>T</i> → <i>T</i> × <i>F</i> | <i>F</i>
<i>F</i> → <b>n</b> | ( <i>E</i> )
</pre>
<p>This grammar has exactly the same language as the above grammar but is unambiguous. For example,
the string “<code>2+3×5</code>” parses uniquely with this new grammar:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<canvas id=unambiguous-parse style="width: 250px; height: 180px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("unambiguous-parse")) {
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        if (v[0] == "*") return f.label(v.substring(1)).setFontStyle("bold").expand(3)
        return f.label(v).setFontStyle("italic").expand(3)
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(null, "E", ["E", ["T", ["F", "*2"]]], "*+", ["T", ["T", ["F", "*3"]], "*×", ["F", "*5"]])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin(25))
}

    onVisible(document.getElementById("unambiguous-parse2"), canvas => delayedRender() )
}

</div>

<h2>Recursive-descent parsing</h2>
<p>
The idea of <sstrongrong>recursive-descent parsing</strong>, also known as
<strong>top-down parsing</strong>, is to parse input while exploring the
corresponding parse tree recursively, starting from the top. 
Let's build a recursive-descent parser!
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, we assume that the input arrives
as tokens of type <code>String</code>. We assume
there is a special token <code>EOF</code> at the end of the stream.
We assume that tokens can be obtained and tested using
the following methods. As the token stream is read, there is always
a current position which moves from left to right during parsing.
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns: the next token in the input stream. */
String peek();

/** Returns: the next token from the input stream.
    Effects: advances the input stream position to the following token. */
String consume();
</pre>
<p>
Using these two methods, we can build two more methods that are useful for parsing:
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns: whether the next token is {@code s}. */
boolean peek(String s) {
    return peek().equals(s);
}

/** Effect: Consumes the next token if it is {@code s},
 *  and advances to the following token.
 *  Throw {@code SyntaxError} otherwise.
 */
void consume(String s) throws SyntaxError {
    if (peek(s)) { consume(); }
    else throw new SyntaxError();
}
</pre>

<p>The idea of recursive-descent parsing is that we implement a separate method
for each nonterminal. Its job is to read all of the tokens from the input stream
that lie under the nonterminal symbol in the parse tree, and usually to produce a
computed result. The content of each method corresponds exactly to the
productions for that nonterminal. The key is that it must be possible to
<em>predict</em> from the tokens seen on the input stream which production
is being used. Recursive-descent parsing is therefore also known as
<strong>predictive parsing</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The grammar above ensures that the operators + and × are <i>left-associative</i> (operations of
equal precedence are performed left-to-right). To simplify exposition, let us temporarily
change the grammar to make them <em>right</em>-associative instead:
</p>
<pre>
<i>E</i> → <i>T</i> + <i>E</i> | <i>T</i>
<i>T</i> → <i>F</i> × <i>T</i> | <i>F</i>
<i>F</i> → <b>n</b> | ( <i>E</i> )
</pre>
<p>
We see later how left-associativity can be regained.
</p>

<p>The method to parse a string generated by the nonterminal <i>E</i> first recursively parses a string generated by <i>T</i> (because both productions for <i>E</i> start with <i>T</i>), then peeks ahead at the next token to see if it is a +. This determines whether the input contains a string generated by <i>T</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>E</i> or just <i>T</i>, thereby determining which production to apply next.
</p>
<pre>
// E → T + E | T
void parseE() throws SyntaxError {
    parseT();
    if (peek("+")) {
        consume();
        parseE();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, the method <code>parseT</code> looks for “<code>×</code>” to decide which
production to use:
</p>
<pre>
// T → F × T | F
void parseT() throws SyntaxError {
    parseF();
    if (peek("×")) {
        consume();
        parseT();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
And <code>parseF()</code> can decide using the first symbol it sees,
assuming we have an appropriate method <code>isNumber()</code>:
</p>
<pre>
// F → n | ( E )
void parseF() throws SyntaxError {
    if (isNumber(peek())) {
        consume();
    } else {
        consume("(");
        parseE();
        consume(")");
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>Building an evaluator</h3>
<p>
So far, the parser we have built is only a <strong>recognizer</strong> that decides
whether the input string is in the language generated by the grammar, i.e. whether
it has a parse tree. It halts normally if so and throws a <code>SyntaxError</code> if not.
It doesn't actually build the parse tree or evaluate the expression.</p>

<p>However, with a few minor modifications, we can easily convert it
into an <b>evaluator</b> that evaluates the expression.
The result type of all the methods becomes <code>int</code>.
</p>
<pre>
int parseE() throws SyntaxError {
    int v = parseT();
    if (peek("+")) {
        consume();
        v = v + parseE();
    }
    return v;
}
int parseT() throws SyntaxError {
    int v = parseF();
    if (peek("×")) {
        consume();
        v = v * parseT();
    }
    return v;
}
int parseF() throws SyntaxError {
    if (isNumber(peek())) {
        return Integer.parseInt(consume());
    } else {
        consume("(");
        int ret = parseE();
        consume(")");
        return ret;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Now we can parse the previous example input and get a result of 17.
</p>
<h2>Abstract syntax trees</h2>
<p>
The output of a parser is usually an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong> (AST), which
differs from a parse tree in that it contains no noninformative terminal
symbols. For example, if we parse the input “2+(3×5)”, we expect to get a tree
like the following.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id=ast-example style="width: 200px; height: 150px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("ast-example")) {
    setFontSize(15)
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        return f.label(v).expand(3)
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(null, "+", "2", ["×", "3", "5"])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin(25))
}
</script>
<p class="caption">
Abstract syntax tree
</p>
</div>
<p>
Note that the parentheses are no longer there! Parentheses are only needed in the input string
to disambiguate parsing. Once the expression is parsed, they are
no longer needed, because the tree structure determines the 
evaluation order. In fact, the expressions “2+(3×5)” and “2+3×5” should produce
exactly the same AST. Note also that the tree does not need to keep track of
nonterminals like <i>T</i> and <i>F</i>; they help get the parse right
but add no useful information to the AST.
</p>
<p>The abstract syntax tree is implemented as a data structure. However, unlike the
tree structures we have seen up until this point, the nodes are of different types.
</p>
<pre>
class Expr {}
enum BinaryOp { PLUS, TIMES }
class Binary extends Expr {
    BinaryOp operator;
    Expr left, right;
    Binary(BinaryOp op, Expr l, Expr r) {
        operator = op;
        left = l;
        right = r;
    }
}
class Number extends Expr {
    int value;
    Number(int v) { value = v; }
}
</pre>
<p>
Using these classes, we can build the AST shown in the previous figure:</p>
<pre>
    Expr e = new Binary(BinaryOp.PLUS,
                new Number(2),
                new Binary(BinaryOp.TIMES, new Number(3), new Number(5)));
</pre>
<h2>Parsing an AST</h2>
<p>
A parser that constructs an AST can now be written by changing our recognizer once more, this
time to return an <code>Expr</code>. Instead of computing integers, as in the evaluator, we just
construct the corresponding AST nodes:
</p>
<pre>
Expr parseE() throws SyntaxError {
    Expr e = parseT();
    if (peek("+")) {
        consume();
        e = new Binary(BinaryOp.PLUS, e, parseE());
    }
    return e;
}
Expr parseT() throws SyntaxError {
    Expr e = parseF();
    if (peek("×")) {
        consume();
        e = new Binary(BinaryOp.TIMES, e, parseT());
    }
    return e;
}
Expr parseF() throws SyntaxError {
    if (isNumber(peek())) {
        return new Number(Integer.parseInt(consume()));
    } else {
        consume("("); // parentheses discarded here!
        Expr e = parseE();
        consume(")");
        return e;
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Limitations of top-down parsing</h2>
<p>
Some grammars cannot be parsed top-down. Unfortunately, they include grammars
that we might naturally want to write. Particularly problematic are grammars
that contain <strong>left-recursive</strong> productions, where the nonterminal being
expanded appears on the left-hand side of its own production. We saw these
in the original grammar specifying the left-associative operators + and ×. The production
\(E → E + T\) is left-recursive, whereas the production used
above, \(E → T + E\), is right-recursive.
<p>
A left-recursive
production doesn't lend itself to predictive parsing, because top-down
construction of the AST means the parser needs
to be able to choose which production to use based on the first symbol seen.
Consider what the method <code>parseE()</code> would look like if we had
been trying to implement the productions \(E → E + T \mid T\) instead:
</p>
<pre>
Expr parseE() throws SyntaxError {
    Expr e = parseE();
    if (peek("+")) {
        consume();
        e = new Binary(BinaryOp.PLUS, e, parseT());
    }
    return e;
}
</pre>
<p class=cont>
But this method won't work: it will cause infinite recursion! The core problem with top-down
parsing of left-recursive grammars that in general an arbitrary number of recursive calls
would be required to build the right parse tree, but the parser has no way to predict how many
from just seeing the beginning of the input.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
grammars with left-recursive productions are very useful, because they create
parse trees that describe left-associative (left-to-right) computation. With the right-recursive
production used above, the input “<code>1 + 2 + 3</code>” is parsed as an AST in which evaluation
proceeds right-to-left:

<div class="figure">
<canvas id=bad-association-fig style="width: 150px; height: 100px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("bad-association-fig")) {
    setFontSize(13)
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        if (v.match(/^t/)) {
            return label(text(italic("t"), subscript(v[1]))).expand(5)
        } else {
            return f.label(v).expand(3)
        }
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(null, "+", "1", ["+", "2", "3"])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin(5))
}
</script>
<span class=caption>Undesirable right-associativity</span>
</div>
Programmers normally expect left-to-right evaluation—and this is even more of a
problem if the operator in question is not associative (for example,
subtraction).
</p>
<h3>Reassociation</h3>
<p>
To fix this, we can <i>reassociate</i> after parsing. To see how this works, note
that the two productions \(E → T + E \mid T \) can be viewed as
shorthand for an infinite list of productions:
</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{align*}
E &→  T \\
E &→  T + T\\
E &→  T + T + T\\
E &→  T + T + T + T \\
& \dots
\end{align*}
\]
</p>
<p>
Another way to express all these productions is to adapt the <b>Kleene star</b>
notation used in regular expressions: the expression <i>A</i><sup>*</sup> means
0 or more concatenated strings, each chosen
from the language of \(A\). For example, if the language of
\(A\) is {“a”, ”bb”}, then the language of \(A^*\)
has an infinite number of elements, including ”a”, ”aa”, ”aaa”, ”bb”, ”bbbb”, ”abba”, ”bbabbbb”, and many more,
including the empty string.
<p>
Using the Kleene star
notation, we can rewrite the infinite list of productions:
</p>
\[
E → T~(~+~T~)^*
\]
<p class=cont>
where the parentheses are being used as a grouping construct (they are
<strong>metasyntax</strong> rather than syntax).
</p>
<p>The point of rewriting the productions in this way is that parsing a use of Kleene star
naturally lends itself to an implementation as a loop. Within that loop, the AST can be
built bottom-up, so that the operator correctly associates to the left:
</p>
<pre>
void parseE() throws SyntaxError {
    Expr e = parseT();
    while (peek("+")) {
        consume();
        e = new Binary(BinaryOp.PLUS, e, parseT());
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Given input &ldquo;\(t_0 + t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \dots\)&rdquo;,
where each of the \(t_i\) stands for a term,
the corresponding abstract syntax tree built by this code looks as follows.
Notice that this AST describes left-to-right-evaluation of the sum.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id=reassociation-fig style="width: 200px; height: 180px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("reassociation-fig")) {
    setFontSize(13)
    setStyle('drawNode', function(f, v) {
        if (v.match(/^t/)) {
            return label(text(italic("t"), subscript(v[1]))).expand(5)
        } else {
            return f.label(v).expand(3)
        }
    })
    setConnectionStyle("intersection")
    const t = tree(null, "...", ["+", ["+", ["+", "t0", "t1"], "t2"], "t3"], "...")
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin(5))
}
</script>
<p class=caption>Reassociated AST</p>
</div>
<p>
Because it allows parsing of left-associative operators, reassociation via
bottom-up tree construction is an important technique for top-down parsing.
</p>

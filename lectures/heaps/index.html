<h1>Priority Queues and Heaps</h1>
<p>
To implement Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm, we need a <b>priority queue</b>: a queue
in which each element has a <b>priority</b> and from which elements are removed in priority order;
that is, the next element to be removed from the queue is always the element of highest
priority currently in the queue. A priority queue is an abstraction with several important uses,
and fortunately, it can be implemented efficiently.</p>

<p>
We have already seen that priority queues are useful for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm
and A<sup>*</sup> search. In these applications, the priority is the best-known estimate of a
shortest distance. Such a queue is called a <b>min-queue</b> because the smaller the distance,
the higher the priority. <b>Max-queues</b> in which larger numbers correspond to
higher priorities can be implemented in essentially the same way.</p>

<p>
Priority queues have other applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In <strong>discrete
event-driven simulation</strong>, events are processed in the
order in which they occur, updating the state of the simulation for each event.
A min-queue is used to store unprocessed events, where the priority is a
timestamp indicating the time of occurrence. Handling one event can generate
new future events, which are added to the queue.</p>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding"><strong>Huffman coding</strong></a> is a data
compression algorithm that optimally compresses individual symbols in a data
stream.
<li>
Priority queues can also be used for sorting: elements to be
sorted can be pushed into the priority queue and then simply removed in sorted
order. In fact, with a good implementation of priority queues, this sorting
algorithm is asymptotically optimal.
</ul>

<h2>Priority queue interface</h2>
<p>
A priority queue can be described via the following interface:
<pre class=load>
<a href="pqueue.java">PriorityQueue.java</a>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The methods described in this interface suffice to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
</p>

<p>It is straightforward to implement priority queues with ordered or unordered lists.
Ordered lists (or sorted arrays) allow constant-time <code>extractMin</code> and linear time <code>add</code>,
whereas unordered lists allow constant-time <code>add</code> and linear time <code>extractMin</code>.
This is not fast enough for many applications, but we can do better.
</p>

<h2>Binary Heap</h2>

<p>A simple, ingenious concrete data structure called a <b>binary heap</b> allows all priority-queue
operations to be done in \(O(\log n)\) time with good constant factors.
</p>
<p>
In computer science, the term <b>heap</b> is unfortunately overloaded.
Binary heaps should not be confused with <b>memory heaps</b>. A <strong>memory
heap</strong> is a low-level data structure used to keep track of the computer's
memory so that the programming language implementation (the <b>language runtime</b>)
knows where to place objects in memory. Here we use “heap” to
refer to binary heaps.
</p>
<p>
A <b>binary</b> heap is a binary tree satisfying the <b>heap invariant</b>:
</p>
<p>
<b>(Heap Invariant)</b> Every node \(n\) in the tree has the highest priority among all nodes in the
subtree rooted at \(n\). Equivalently, the priority of any node is at least as high as
the priority of any of its children. Equivalently still, a heap stores its highest
priority element at the root, and the left and right subtrees are also both heaps.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example of a binary heap in which smaller values have higher priority.
  Note that the root of each subtree contains the highest-priority element in that subtree.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=heap_example style="height:140px; width: 200px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  with (new CFigure("heap_example")) {
    setFontSize(14)
    setConnectionStyle('intersection')
    align("LR", "TB", margin(),
        tree(lightStyle(), 1, [3, [6, 12, 9], 5], [4, 7, 10])
    )
  }
</script>
</div>
<p>
  It is possible to manipulate binary heaps as tree data structures, with
  pointers between nodes.  However, a more efficient, pointer-free
  representation is possible if the binary heap satisfies a second invariant:
</p>
<p>
  <b>(Shape Invariant)</b> For every h, if there exists a node \(n\) at depth \(h\),
  then all \(2^{h-1}\) possible nodes of depth \(h–1\) exist in the tree, along
  with every possible node to the left of \(n\) of depth \(h\). It follows that if \(h\) is
  the maximum depth of a node in the tree, the leaves of the tree occur only at
  depths \(h\) and \(h–1\).
</p>
   <div class=figure>
    <canvas id=heap_shape style="width: 150px; height: 80px"></canvas>
    <script class=graphics>
      with (new CFigure("heap_shape")) {
        const m = margin()
        const lr = m.lr().toTop(10), ll = point(), top = point(variable(), m.y0())
        const p1 = point(), p2 = point()
        const x1 = variable()
        const hl1 = point(x1, m.y0())
        const hl2 = point(x1, m.y1())
        setFontSize(16)
        setFontName("Palatino, Times")
        const hline = line(hl1, hl2).setStartArrow("arrow").setEndArrow("arrow").setArrowSize(7)
            .addLabel(text(italic("h")), 0.5, 8)
        polygon(top, lr, p2, p1, ll)
        align("center", "abut", p2, vspace(10), p1)
        align("none", "center", ll, p1)
        align("none", "center", lr, p2)
        align("none", "center", ll, m.ll())
        align("none", "TB", hline,  m)
        align("abut", "none", m.cl(), hspace(4), hline)
        align("center", "none", hl1, hl2)
        align("abut", "center", hl2, hspace(15), ll)
        align("distribute", "none", ll, top, lr)
      }
    </script>
   </div>
<p class=cont>In fact, the example tree above also satisfies this shape invariant.</p>

<div class=exercise>
A binary search tree with 5 nodes with keys 1..5 satisfies both the Order invariant on its keys and also the
usual binary search tree invariant. What range of heights is possible for such a tree?
<p class=answer>
It cannot have any left children, so it must have height 4.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Representing heaps as arrays</h2>
<p>
The shape invariant makes it possible to represent
the binary heap as a resizable array. The elements of the tree are placed in the 
array row by row from top to bottom, reading each row from left to right and placing the
nodes in the array from left to right. The heap structure illustrated above would be represented by
the following array of length 9, with array indices shown on the bottom.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=heap_array_rep style="height: 50px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
    with (new CFigure("heap_array_rep")) {
        const elemw = variable()
        const elems = [1, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7, 10, 12, 9].map(n => rectangle().setW(elemw).addText(n + ""))
        setFontSize(14)
        setFontStyle("italic")
        const indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].map(i => label(text(italic("" + i))))
        align("distribute", "center", ...indices)
        group(elems).align("abut", "TB")
        for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            align("center", "none", elems[i], indices[i])
        }
        align("none", "abut", elems[0], vspace(10), indices[0])

        align("left", "top", elems[0], margin())
        align("right", "top", elems[8], margin())
        elems[0].setH(20)
    }
</script>
</div>
<p>
Remarkably, this array represents
the tree structure without pointers. The shape invariant guarantees that the
children of the node at index \(i\) are found at indices \(2i+1\) (left) and
\(2i+2\) (right). Conversely, the parent of a node at index i is found at
\(\lfloor (i–1)/2 \rfloor \). So we can walk up and down through the tree using
simple arithmetic. There is no need to store or follow pointers!
</p>
<h3>Binary heap operations</h3>
<h4>Add</h4>
<p>
Adding a new node to the heap is done by adding the element at the end of the array to preserve the shape invariant. However, the heap invariant may not hold, because its priority may be greater than its parent's priority. To restore the heap invariant, we <strong>bubble up</strong> the element by swapping it with its parent until either it reaches the root or its parent node has higher priority. This requires at most \(\lg n\) swaps, because the tree is perfectly balanced. So adds take at most \(O(\log n)\) time.</p>

<p>In the example above, if we add an element with priority 2, it is first
placed at the end of the array, then bubbles up past the 5 and the 3, finally
ending up where 3 was. It stops bubbling up at that point because its parent
has higher priority (1). You can see the bubbling-up steps in the following figure.
</p>

<div class=figure>
<canvas id=heap_example_add style="width: 250px; height: 150px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  with (new CFigure("heap_example_add", true)) {
    setFontSize(14)
    setConnectionStyle('intersection')
    const t = tree(lightStyle(), 1, [3, [6, 12, 9], [5, 2, undefined]], [4, 7, 10])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin())
    let f1 = addFrame()
    setTextStyle("#c30")
    const n5 = after(f1, label("5"))
    const n2 = after(f1, label("2"))
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f1).findGraphic(2), n5)
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f1).findGraphic(5), n2)
    align("LR", "TB", after(f1, label("X")), t.view(f1).findGraphic(5))
    align("LR", "TB", after(f1, label("X")), t.view(f1).findGraphic(2))
    let f2 = addFrame()
    setTextStyle("#c80")
    const n3 = after(f2, label("3"))
    const n2b = after(f2, label("2"))
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f2).findGraphic(3), n2b)
    align("abut", "center", n2, hspace(5), n3)
    align("LR", "TB", after(f2, label("X")), t.view(f2).findGraphic(3))
    align("LR", "TB", after(f2, label("X")), n2)
  }
</script>
</div>

<h4>ExtractMin</h4>
<p>
The minimum element is always at the root (location 0 in the array). We can extract it,
but we need to replace it with something.
The last element in the array is a good candidate. We move it to the root
of the tree. This reestablishes the shape invariant, but the heap invariant may now be broken.
We fix the heap invariant by <strong>bubbling down</strong> the element (sometimes it is called <strong>sifting down</strong>).
The element is compared against its
two children. If either child is higher priority, it is swapped with the higher
priority child. The process repeats until either the element is higher priority than
its children or it becomes a leaf.</p>

<p>Here is what happens with our example heap. We delete the 1 at the root and replace it with 5,
which was the last element in the array. Then we bubble the 5 down. We compare it with 2 and 4. It is
lower priority than both, so we swap it with the higher priority child, which is 2. (We must swap it with the higher priority child to maintain the heap invariant, because that child will become the parent of the other child.) We then compare with the new children, 6 and 3, and swap with 3, at which point 5 becomes a leaf. The heap invariant is now reestablished.
</p>
<div class=figure>
<canvas id=heap_example_pop style="width: 250px; height: 150px"></canvas>
<script class=graphics>
  with (new CFigure("heap_example_pop", true)) {
    setFontSize(14)
    setConnectionStyle('intersection')
    const t = tree(lightStyle(), 5, [2, [6, 12, 9], 3], [4, 7, 10])
    align("LR", "TB", t, margin())
    let f1 = addFrame()
    setTextStyle("#c30")
    const n2 = after(f1, label("2"))
    const n5 = after(f1, label("5"))
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f1).findGraphic(5), n2)
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f1).findGraphic(2), n5)
    align("LR", "TB", after(f1, label("X")), t.view(f1).findGraphic(5))
    align("LR", "TB", after(f1, label("X")), t.view(f1).findGraphic(2))
    let f2 = addFrame()
    setTextStyle("#c80")
    const n3 = after(f2, label("3"))
    const n5b = after(f2, label("5"))
    align("abut", "center", n5, hspace(5), n3)
    align("abut", "center", t.view(f2).findGraphic(3), n5b)
    align("LR", "TB", after(f2, label("X")), n5)
    align("LR", "TB", after(f2, label("X")), t.view(f2).findGraphic(3))
  }
</script>
</div>

<p>Again, at most \(\lg n\) swaps are needed.</p>

<h4>IncreasePriority</h4>
<p>
We may wish to change the priority of an element in the queue. Assigning a new priority to an element maintains the shape invariant, but may break the heap invariant. To reestablish the heap invariant, we may need to bubble the element up if we increase the priority (which for a min-queue means decreasing the value) or down if we decrease the priority.
</p>

<h2>Heapsort</h2>
<p>
The heapsort algorithm sorts an array by first <strong>heapifying</strong> it to make
it satisfy the heap invariant. Then <code>extractMin()</code> is used
repeatedly to read out the elements in increasing order. This can be used to
sort an array in \(O(n \log n)\) time. That repeatedly calling <code>extractMin()</code>
takes \(O(n \log n)\) time is obvious, but what about heapifying?
</p>
<p>
Heapifying can be done by bubbling every element down, starting from the last element in the array
representation and working backward:
</p>
<pre>
for (i = (n/2)-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
  bubbleDown(i);
}
</pre>
<p>This loop works correctly because it has the following loop invariant: when
the loop is considering node \(i\), the subtrees of all following nodes
(nodes \(i+1\) through \(n-1\)) are already heaps. Therefore the two subtrees of node \(i\) already
satisfy the heap invariant: they occur in the part of the array that has
already been scanned. Bubbling down node \(i\) is all that is needed
to make the entire subtree rooted at \(i\) also satisfy the invariant.
</p>
<canvas id=heapify_layers style="width: 180px; height: 150px; float: right"></canvas>
<p>The total time required to heapify is linear, perhaps surprisingly. No work
is done on the half of the elements in indices \(\lfloor n/2\rfloor\dots n-1\) because these are all leaves. 
Considering the rest of the elements, as suggested by the figure at the right,
at most a quarter need to be bubbled down one step, at most an eighth
need to be bubbled down two steps, and so on. So the total work is
at most:
</p>
<script class=graphics>
with (new CFigure("heapify_layers")) {
    let cr = canvasRect().inset(2)
    let t = polygon(cr.uc(), cr.ll(), cr.lr())
    let [l4, l0, l1, l2, l3] = [0,1,2,3,4].map(() => horzLine())
    align("center", "distribute", t.points[0], point(), point(), l4, l0, l1, l2, l3)
    align("LR", "bottom", t, l3)
    collinear(t.points[0], l0.start(), l1.start(), l2.start(), l3.start(), l4.start())
    setFontSize(15)
    setFontName("Times")
    label(text(italic("n"), "/2 : 0")).at(l3.lc().toTop(10))
    label(text(italic("n"), "/4 : 1")).at(l2.lc().toTop(10))
    label(text(italic("n"), "/8 : 2")).at(l1.lc().toTop(10))
    label(text(italic("n"), "/16 : 3")).at(l0.lc().toTop(10))
}
</script>

\begin{equation}
T = n/4 + 2n/8 + 3n/16 + 4n/32 + \dots + kn/2^{k+1} + \dots
\end{equation}
<p>
This series is easy to solve by taking the difference of two series in the usual
way:
\(T = 2T - T = n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + \dots = O(n) \).
</p>
<p>
Hence, we can see that heapifying is actually the fast part of heapsort!
</p>

<h2>Finding elements in the queue</h2>
<p>
To implement <code>increasePriority()</code>, an implementation must have a
way, ideally fast, to find the element whose priority is to be updated. This can be
accomplished by using a hash table to look up the position of elements in the
underlying data structure, or by storing the position of the element in the
queue into the element itself. Using the Concept design pattern, we would
pass an object to the priority queue that provides operations for manipulating
queue elements, providing an interface like the following:
</p>
<pre class=load>
<a href="elemops.java">ElemOps.java</a>
</pre>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>
There are many variations on this basic data structure, some of which can yield
significant performance improvements under the right circumstances.
</p>
<p>
When using priority queues to implement Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on dense
graphs, the performance limiting operation is often <code>increasePriority()</code>,
which as we have seen takes logarithmic time. <b>Fibonacci heaps</b> and
<b>relaxed heaps</b> are heap data structures that can do <code>increasePriority()</code>
in only constant (amortized) time, yielding a speedup. Since these data structures
do not enforce the Shape invariant, they require pointers to implement. Hence, although
their asymptotic performance is the same or better than a simple binary heap on all
operations, they incur a higher constant factor slowdown that is typically not
worth paying.
</p>
<p>
In many search applications, the binary heap will tend to contain a lot of
elements with the same priority—especially, many elements with the same
priority as the root.  A simple optimization is to store all elements with the
highest priority separately in a resizable array, significantly reducing the amount
of bubbling down that is done by <code>extractMin()</code>.
</p>
<p>
We can also exploit the linear-time performance of heapifying to make it
cheaper to add new elements to a binary heap. Rather than immediately bubbling
new elements up, we simply append them to a small unordered region of size \(O(\lg
n)\) elements at the end of the array. For <code>extractMin()</code>, the smallest
element could be in the unordered region, so it must scan these elements
too—but this small scan takes logarithmic time and hence does not harm
asymptotic performance.  If the size of the unordered region becomes larger
than \(O(\lg n)\) elements, we restore the heap invariant for the whole array
by heapifying the unordered region into the rest of the array. If
we heapify in a way that only touches the ancestors of the unordered regions,
it takes \(O(\lg n)\) time and hence \(O(1)\) amortized time per element added.
</p>

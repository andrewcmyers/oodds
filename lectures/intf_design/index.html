<h1>Designing and documenting interfaces</h1>
<p>
Good software engineering is about dividing code into modules that separate
concerns and localize them within modules. These modules then interact via
<b>interfaces</b> that provide abstraction barriers supporting local reasoning.
Let's look more closely at the problem of designing good interfaces.
</p>

<h2>What makes a good interface?</h2>
<p>
Interfaces exist at the boundaries of the modular decomposition. An interface will
be most effective when it has the following four properties:
<ol>
<li><p>It provides a strong <b>abstraction barrier</b> between modules.</li>
<li><p>The interface should be as <b>narrow</b> as possible while providing the functionality needed by clients.
<li><p>The interface should be <b>clearly specified</b> and understandable without seeing the implementation.
<li><p>The interface should permit <b>efficient and straightforward implementation</b>.
</ol>
<p>
We've already discussed abstraction earlier; our goal here is to examine the
second two attributes of a good interface.
</p>
<p>
By a <b>narrow</b> interface, we mean an interface that exposes few operations or
other potential dependencies between modules. The opposite of a narrow interface is
a <b>wide</b> interface, one that exposes many operations or potential dependencies
between modules.
</p>
<p>
The choice between a narrow interface and a wide interface is not always obvious,
because there are benefits to each approach. We can compare and contrast the philosophies:

<table class=rowlines>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>narrow</th><th>wide</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>few operations, limited functionality for clients to use</td>
  <td>many operations, much functionality available for clients</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>easy to extend, maintain, reimplement</td>
  <td>hard to extend, maintain, reimplement</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>loose coupling: clients less likely to be disrupted by changes</td>
  <td>tight coupling: clients more likely to be disrupted by changes</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
In principle, it's possible to make the interface so narrow that it interferes
with clients getting their job done in an efficient and straightforward way.
But this is not the usual mistake of software designers; more typically, they
make interfaces too wide, leading to software that is hard to maintain, 
extend, and reimplement without breaking client code.
</p>
<p>
The rule of thumb, then, is that interfaces should be made only as wide as necessary
for efficient client code to be written in a straightforward way.
</p>

<h3>Convenience methods</h3>

<p>
Often when a narrow interface feels awkward to use, it is possible to address
this problem by writing <b>convenience methods</b> that are implemented
outside the module, using only the narrow interface that the module provides.
Clients can then use the convenience methods to avoid code duplication, but
without widening the interface and thereby introducing new dependencies between
modules.
</p>
<p>
When a module's interface is wide and there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid
this by writing convenience methods or by separating the module into multiple
modules, it is often a sign that you haven't managed to separate program
concerns into different modules. When concerns are not sufficiently separated,
there are <em>inherently</em> too many interactions between the different parts
of the program to define a narrow interface between the components.
</p>
<p>
Object-oriented languages offer a nice pattern for separating convenience methods from
the core functionality of a class: convenience methods are factored out into an
abstract class that is intended to be subclassed to provide the missing core
functionality.  The core functionality, corresponding to a narrow interface, is
provided by the subclass by overriding the unimplemented methods. This
implementation strategy is used extensively in the Java Collection Framework.
The collection classes offer a wide interface to client code, but most of their
methods are implemented by abstract classes such as
<code>AbstractCollection</code>, <code>AbstractList</code>,
<code>AbstractQueue</code>, <code>AbstractSequentialList</code>, and
<code>AbstractSet</code>. This implementation strategy keeps interfaces
narrower and separates concerns.  Another nice feature is that the subclass can
even override convenience methods if there is a more efficient way to implement
them than the generic way in the context of this particular implementation.
</p>

<h2>How should we document interfaces?</h2>
<p>
Once we've decided what operations and other functionality belongs in an interface,
what documentation should be added? An important principle can guide us here:
documentation <em>is</em> code, code for <em>humans</em> to run. The documentation is
a human-readable abstraction of the code that (depending on which documentation we're
talking about) supports programmers writing client code or maintaining the implementation.
</p>
<p>
The most important function of documentation is to provide <em>specifications</em>
of what code does. Specifications are particularly useful for supporting client code,
but also help implementers.
</p>

<h3><em>Where</em> to document?</h3>
<p>
According to the principle that documentation is code, the best place for documentation
is with the code itself, in the form of program comments. When this is not practical,
code documentation should be linked from code so it can be easily accessed. Javadoc
documentation is a good example of this principle in action: the documentation is
extracted from the code, so it cannot be separated from it.
</p>
<p>
Documenting code separately in separate documents may be appealing, but the more
separate documentation is from the code it describes, the more it tends to
diverge from the code. The more it diverges from the code, the less useful it
becomes and the less programmers rely on (or look at) the documentation. Both
documentation and code require programmers' attention to stay fresh!
</ul>
<h3><em>When</em> to document? (Early!)</h3>
<div class="figure">
<canvas id="design-process" style="width: 400px; height: 280px"></canvas>
</div>
<script type="application/javascript" class=graphics>

    let l1, l2, l3, l4, l5
    function design_step(name) {
        const r = rectangle().addText(name).setFontSize(10)
        equal(r.w(), times(2, r.h()))
        return r
    }

<p>
Too often, programmers write their documentation at the end of the design and implementation
process, as a kind of afterthought. The workflow of design, coding, debugging, and documenting
tends to look like the figure on the left. A lot of time is spent debugging because the design
is not worked out carefully enough. In general, spending a lot of time debugging is a sign
you haven't worked hard enough on the design.
</p>
<p>
Documenting the design early, as shown in the figure on the right, helps you work bugs
out of your design and to understand your design better. Typically, this makes both
coding and debugging faster. Sometimes your code just works on the first try!
</p>
<p>
The moral is that documentation is not mere esthetic decoration for your code. It
is a tool that can improve your designs and save you time in the long run.
</p>

<h3><em>What</em> to write?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><b>Know your audience</b>: Tell your reader the things they need
to know in a way they can understand.
But your reader's attention is precious.
Don't waste space on obvious, boring things. Filler
distracts from what's important.
Avoid “filler” comments that don't add any value and distract from
what's important, such as:</p>
<pre>
x = x + 1 // add one to x
</pre>
<li><p><b>Be coherent</b>: avoid interruptions. Better to write one clear
explanation than to intersperse explanatory comments throughout the code.</li>

<li><p><b>Respect the abstraction barrier</b>: write specifications in terms the
    reader/client can understand without knowing the implementation. Don't
    expose implementation details in specifications.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>An example: polynomials</h2>

<h3>Step 1: describe the abstraction by writing an overview comment.</h3>
<pre>
/** A polynomial over a single variable x
 * Example: 2 + 3x - 5.3x<sup>3</sup>
 */
class Poly {
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
As this code example shows, it's often helpful in a class or interface overview
to introduce a notation for describing the values of the abstraction. This
notation can then be used when writing specifications of the methods.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: choose operations</h3>

<p>Next, we think carefully about what methods are essential while trying to
avoid unnecessarily widening the interface, and write specifications for
these methods.
</p>

<p> In choosing operations, it is helpful to notice that well-designed methods
usually fall into one of three categories: <b>creators</b>, <b>observers</b>
(sometimes called <b>queries</b>), and <b>mutators</b> (also known as
<b>commands</b>).

<ul>

<li><b>Creators</b>: these methods are used to create new objects, particularly
those of the class being implemented.
</li>

<li><b>Observers</b>: these methods report on object state but have no side effects.</li>

<li><b>Mutators</b>: the primary purpose of these methods is to have a side effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we have seen already, creators are often constructors for the class being
defined, but they may also be methods called <b>factory methods</b>, which are
implemented by calling a constructor. By hiding the constructor used inside a
factory method, looser coupling is achieved because the factory method can be
changed to use a different constructor or even to create an object of a
different class.  The creators for a given class or interface may be also
methods of a different class or interface. In fact, since interfaces cannot
have static methods or constructors, creators for an interface type
<em>must</em> be methods of another class. 
</p>

<p>
Abstractions that do not have any mutators that can change their state, such as
<code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code>, are <b>immutable</b>
abstractions. Abstractions with mutators are <b>mutable</b>. Both kinds of abstractions
have their uses. The advantage of immutable abstractions is that their objects can be
shared freely by different code modules.
</p> 

<p>The useful principle of <b>command–query
separation</b> guides method design. The principle says that
a given operation should fall into one of these three
categories, rather than multiple categories. This makes the interface easier to
use. For example, you don't want to be forced to have side effects in order to
check the state of an object.</p>
<p>Considering each of the categories in turn, we might come up with operations like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Creators:</b>
  <ul>
	<li><code>zero</code>: create the zero polynomial</li>
	<li><code>monomial</code>: create a polynomial with form ax<sup>b</sup></li>
	<li><code>fromArray</code>: create a polynomial with coefficients defined by an array of <code>double</code>s.</li>
	<li><code>derivative</code>: create a polynomial that is the derivative of the given polynomial (also an observer).</li>
	<li><code>plus</code>: create a polynomial that is the sum of two polynomials.</li>
	<li><code>minus</code>: create a polynomial that is the difference of two polynomials.</li>
  </ul>
<li><b>Observers:</b>
  <ul>
	<li><code>degree</code>: report the maximum exponent with non-zero degree.</li>
	<li><code>coefficient</code>: report one coefficient of the polynomial</li>
	<li><code>evaluate</code>: evaluate the polynomial at a given value for x</li>
	<li><code>toString</code>: generate a string representation of the polynomial</li>
	<li><code>equals</code>: report equality of a polynomial with another object.</li>
  </ul>
<li><b>Mutators:</b>
  Since polynomials are immutable, we should not have any mutators.
</ul>

<p>Notice that we have not discussed how we are going to implement
this polynomial abstraction. That is a good thing. We want to expose the
operations that clients are going to need. We might have to make sacrifices
because some operations are hard or expensive to implement, but that should
be done only after thinking about the ideal interface.
</p>

<p>We want to avoid adding operations that we can implement efficiently using
existing operations. For example, we might be tempted to have an operation that
finds zeros of the polynomial. However, such an operation can probably be
implemented efficiently using either factoring (for low-degree polynomials) or
numerically via Newton's method, using <code>evaluate</code> and
<code>derivative</code>. Such a convenience method can be provided by a different
module.
</p>

<p><b>Standard operations.</b> Some operations are so useful
that it is worth thinking about whether you will want them for
<em>every</em> data abstraction you define:
<ul>
<li><p><b>equals</b>. Testing whether two values are equal is fundamental
to mathematics and to programming, and many standard Java classes, such as
in the Java Collections Framework, rely on the ability to compare whether two
objects are equal. However, implementing the <b>equals()</b> method is
surprisingly tricky, because the notion of equality itself is more complex than
it might appear at first glance. Java objects inherit a built-in implementation
of the <code>equals()</code> method based on <b>reference equality</b>: two objects are
equal if and only if they have the same reference. Reference equality is what the
built-in operator <code>==</code> implements.
For mutable abstractions, reference equality is usually the right
implementation already, so no additional code needs to be written.
For immutable abstractions, however, we frequently want to
redefine equality so that distinct objects with the same state are treated
as equal. For example, the method <code>String.equals()</code> compares the
characters of two strings rather than the object references.
How to go about implementing equality is discussed in more detail below.

<li><p><b>toString</b>. It is very useful for debugging to be able to
print a string representation of an object. Ideally, two objects should have
equal answers for <code>toString()</code> if and only if they are equal
according to <code>equals()</code>.

<li><p><b>hashCode</b>. If you want to use an object as key in a hash table,
it needs to have a <code>hashCode()</code> method. Two objects that are equal
according to <code>equals()</code> <em>must</em> have the same hashcode.
Two application-generated objects that are not equal according to
<code>equals()</code> should have different hash codes with high probability.

<li><p><b>a copy constructor</b>. For mutable abstractions (that is,
abstractions that have mutators), it is often useful to be able to make a copy of an
existing mutable object. Unless mutators are used on either the copy or the
original, the two should be indistinguishable. There should be no way to affect
the original by mutating the copy, or vice versa. Among other uses, copies are
handy for building test cases. The copying method should override <code>Object.clone()</code>.
</ul>


<h3>Step 3: write specifications</h3>
<p>We have a rough idea of the operations we want to support. But before we
start implementing, we should write clear, precise specifications so that we know when
we have implemented the operations properly.
</p>
<p>For each method, we need to define a <b>signature</b> that gives the types of
the parameters, the type of the return value, and the possible exceptions that could
be thrown. We should also define a specification (<b>spec</b>) that describes what the
client needs to know (and is allowed to know) about the behavior of the method.</p>
<p>For example, we might write a spec for the <b>degree</b> method as follows:</p>
<pre>
/** Returns: the degree of the polynomial, the largest exponent with a non-zero
 * coefficient. */
int degree();
</pre>
<h4>Spec clauses</h4>
<p>To help us construct a good spec, it is useful to think of the spec as being composed of
various <b>clauses</b>. These cover different things the client needs to know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Postconditions</b>: The <b>returns clause</b> describes what results come back when the method is called.
For creators, we can also write this as a <b>creates</b> clause, which is a shorthand promising that the
client can treat the returned object as distinct from any existing object.
<li><b>Preconditions</b>: The <b>requires clause</b> describes what arguments the caller is permitted to supply.
   A variant of this clause is a <b>checks clause</b>, which promises that the code will check certain
   preconditions and halt the program with an error if the preconditions are violated. The only difference
   between these two versions of the precondition is that one can make debugging easier.
<li><b>Effects</b>: The <b>effects clause</b> describes what side effects happen to the state of objects.
A related clause is a <b>modifies clause</b>, which enumerates objects to which some effect occurs without
specifying what the change is.
<li><b>Examples</b>: Sometimes an example or two can help clarify what the method does.
</ul>
<p>
The key to writing good specs is to think of the spec as a <b>contract</b> between the client and the implementer.
Like a legal contract, its main goal is to help everyone figure out who to blame when things go wrong. This is
very important for successful software engineering, especially in a large team.
</p>

<h4>Default conditions</h4>
<p>
To keep specs concise, it is useful to have some default preconditions that do
not need to be stated explicitly. A good example of such a precondition is an
expectation that no argument values to a method are <code>null</code>.  If a
method might be able to handle a null argument, the method spec should
explicitly say so. Otherwise, clients should assume that null is an invalid
argument. In the absence of such a default precondition, most method preconditions
will have rules about the possibility that various arguments are null, creating
tedious clutter that distracts from the main point of the preconditions. Similarly,
it is useful to assume that results returned from methods are not null unless the
method spec explicitly states that the result can be null.
</p>

<h4>Using Javadoc</h4>

<p>Javadoc doesn't completely support the clauses described above, although
there are ongoing efforts to improve it. If you want to use Javadoc to generate
HTML documentation, you can adapt this documentation strategy accordingly. The
key to success is not that you need to have explicit clauses, but that you
should know for each thing you write in the comment which clause it belongs to.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: implement operations</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to implement our specifications! And we will want to write
some documentation of that implementation. This is a topic for later.
</p>

<h2>Antipatterns in interface design</h2>
<p>
<b>Getters and setters.</b>
Getters are observer methods that report the contents of fields, and setters
are mutators that change the values of instance variables to a given value. You
may see advice that the programmer should implement getters and setters to
allow access to private instance variables.  However, it is not a good idea to
reflexively add getters and setters to classes you write. This pattern is
actually an <b>antipattern</b> to be avoided. Getters and setters weaken the
abstraction barrier by advertising the existence of instance
variables—something that should be hidden by the abstraction barrier. Further,
the instance variables do not necessarily correspond directly to the
observations and mutations that make sense for the object.
</p>

<p>
Pragmatically, if an instance variable has both a getter and a setter, it becomes
hard to enforce any kind of abstraction barrier, since clients can modify it
arbitrarily. Doing so is not much better than making the instance variable public.
Of course, we can define setters with preconditions, but it is
better to think of such setters as mutators.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rep exposure.</b>

Even getters can be dangerous. A common pitfall is to inadvertently allow
modification of the data by exposing mutable state from inside the abstraction.
Making mutable parts of the representation directly accessible to clients is
an error known as <b>rep exposure</b>.  For example, suppose we store the
coefficients of a polynomial as an array in the instance variable
<tt>coefficients</tt> and provide a getter:
</p>

<pre>
 private double[] coefficients;
 public double[] getCoefficients() {
    return coefficients;
 }
</pre>
<p>
Now a client can get access to the internal array of coefficients and
change the polynomial in an unconstrained way, possibly breaking its class invariant.
Even worse, the client may have no idea that it is causing damage by changing the 
array. To avoid this damage, information in the array should be returned to the client
in a way that does not expose the internal state, perhaps by returning a copy the array or
an iterator over the array elements.
</p>
<p>
Rep exposure can also be caused by creators and mutators.  If a creator or a mutator
takes an argument that is a mutable object, and then makes that object directly
part of the object representation, the client may retain the ability to modify the
mutable object through a reference it is holding. For example,
a setter <code>setCoefficients()</code> that allowed a client to override the polynomial's
coefficients with a new array would be just as bad as <code>getCoefficients()</code>.
A well-defended abstraction barrier
requires that clients not hold any references to mutable state inside the implementation,
because they could use those references to break the implementation, whether accidentally
or maliciously.
</p>
<p>The moral is that some observers and some mutators may look like getters and
setters, but you should not reflexively implement instance-variable accessors.
Instead, choose observers and mutators that are appropriate to the abstraction
being designed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Default constructors.</b>
Another overrated operation is the default constructor. It is the
job of constructors to create a properly initialized object. Unfortunately,
one often sees code that uses a default constructor to create the object,
then initializes the fields using setters. Until the fields are initialized,
the object will not satisfy the class invariant, and the setters are prone to
being misused by confused clients. In situations where one is tempted to have
a default constructor, a better approach is to use a real constructor
to perform initialization, or to use the Builder pattern, which we discuss later.
</p>

<h2>Implementing equality</h2>

<p>
To implement an <code>equals()</code> method, it is necessary to think about
what equality means for the objects you are implementing.  Equality is a deep
subject that mathematicians and computer scientists are still arguing about! As
software developers aiming for effective abstractions, we need to think about it
too.  There are two natural ways to define equality on two values:
<ul>
<li><p><b>Leibniz equality.</b> The mathematician
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>
said that two things should be equal if and only if they are indistinguishable.
</p>

<li><b>State equality.</b> Some Java classes implement equality by comparing the
current state of two objects, as reported by all of their observers.  For
example, two Java collections report themselves equal if they contain the
same objects.
</ul>


<p>
True Leibniz equality means that equal objects should be indistinguishable now
and forever, whereas state equality only guarantees that objects remain
indistinguishable until one of them is mutated. For example, two Java
collections that are considered equal might stop being “equal” later on
when elements are added to or removed from one of them. A notion of equality
that can change is error-prone, because it can lead to invariants being broken.
For example, objects used as keys in Java collections need to satisfy
invariants with the data structure that implements the collection. Mutating
these objects breaks the invariants of the data structure.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, although the Java specification for the <code>equals()</code> method
does not require Leibniz equality, as a rule of thumb, it is best when feasible to implement
Leibniz equality to avoid the above problems. Since mutable
objects are only really indistinguishable when they are the same object, this
rule implies that mutable objects should <em>not</em> define their own
<code>equals()</code>, but instead simply inherit <code>Object.equals()</code>.
</p>

<p>Two immutable objects, such as
<code>String</code>s, can be indistinguishable through all of their observer
operations and should in that case be considered equal. Immutable abstractions
<em>should</em> override <code>equals()</code> and implement state equality, 
since state equality and Leibniz equality are essentially the same for
immutable objects.
</p>

<p>
There is one important way that immutable objects can be distinguished even
though they look the same through all of their observer methods, and that is to
compare them using the operator <code>==</code>, which tests equality of object
references. This operator unfortunately breaks the
abstraction barrier for immutable abstractions, so good code will avoid using
it on immutable abstractions except in special situations.
</p>

<p>
The Java specification for <code>Object.equals()</code> does not require
Leibniz equality, but it does require that it satisfy some properties that
Leibniz equality implies. It must be an equivalence relation: reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive.  Further, it should return <code>false</code> when a
comparison is made between an object and the special value <code>null</code>.
And its result should remain the same as long as no modifications are made to
“information used in equals comparisons on the objects” (a rather circular
definition!) There is some flexibility in this spec, but meeting this is
surprisingly difficult in the presence of subtyping.
</p>
<p>
One challenge of implementing <code>equals()</code> is that its signature
requires the ability to compare against values of any object type:
<pre>
   boolean equals(Object o);
</pre>
<p>
Before the method can test equality of the object <code>this</code> and the
object <code>o</code>,  it must first determine if object <code>o</code> is the
right kind of object, and in that case obtain a reference to the object with a
static type that permits checking it.
<p>
Since our <code>Polynomial</code> class is immutable, we should override the
<code>equals()</code> method to implement state equality. For example, the
code might look like the following:
</p>
<pre>
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == null) return false;
        if (o instanceof Polynomial) {
            Polynomial p = (Polynomial) o;
            return Arrays.equal(coefficients, p.coefficients);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
Using the new Java 17 syntax for <code>instanceof</code> with <b>pattern matching</b>,
we can avoid the clunky explicit cast operation:
<pre>
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof Polynomial p) {
            return Arrays.equal(coefficients, p.coefficients);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
A problem with this approach is that it can violate the symmetry
property required by the specification of <code>equals()</code>. Suppose
there is some subtype of <code>Polynomial</code> that has more
observers and more state than <code>Polynomial</code> does. Then, a
<code>Polynomial</code> might consider itself equal to an object of that
subtype, whereas that object's own <code>equals</code> would conclude
through an <code>instanceof</code> test that the objects are not equal.
</p>
<p>
Symmetry can be restored by using the Java feature of <b>reflection</b>,
<b>reflection</b>, in which we access properties of types at run time.
</p>
<pre>
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        if (o instanceof Polynomial p) {
            return Arrays.equal(coefficients, p.coefficients);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
This code uses the reflective method <code>getClass()</code> to access the
run-time class of the objects being compared. Two objects can only be
considered equal if they are implemented by the same class.
</p>
<p>
This reflection-based approach is often considered a best practice for
implementing <code>equals()</code>, but even it is not entirely satisfactory.
If two classes provide alternate implementations of the same
immutable interface, Leibniz equality says that we should consider their objects equal
even when their classes are different, if the objects cannot be distinguished using their
interfaces. For example, suppose classes <code>CartesianPoint</code>
and <code>PolarPoint</code> provide different implementations of an
interface <code>Point</code> representing a mathematical point. It should be
possible for two points to be equal even if their underlying representations are
different, and an implementation of <code>Cartesian.equals()</code> like the following
would allow that equality:
<pre>
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof Point p) {
            return (x == p.x() && y == p.y());
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
These implementation challenges reflect a problem in the specification of
<code>Object.equals()</code>. The expected mathematical properties of equality
are in tension with the approach of asking each object to be able to decide
whether it is equal to all other objects. There are approaches to equality that
are more philosophically consistent, but since the Java libraries rely on the
<code>equals()</code> method in many places, we have to learn to live with
<code>equals()</code> and sometimes strike compromises.
</p>
<h3>Equality at a type</h3>
<p>
An alternative way to handle equality that is consistent and flexible 
is to implement equality <em>at a particular type</em>.
For example, we might evaluate equality of two polynomials
using a <em>static</em> method of the class <code>Polynomial</code>:
<pre>
class Polynomial {
    /** Returns whether p and q are equal as polynomials. */
    static boolean equal(Polynomial p, Polynomial q) {
        return Arrays.equals(p.coefficients, q.coefficients);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This method does not try to answer whether two objects are truly equal; it only
answers whether they are “polynomial-equal”. It is obviously reflexive,
transitive, and symmetric, and simpler to implement. Unfortunately, the
standard Java libraries are not designed to work with this notion of equality,
and it does not implement Leibniz equality, because it may consider
distinguishable objects to be equal. On the other hand, both notions of
equality can coexist, and an advantage of this approach is that it is
compatible with the way we later suggest writing generic code.
</p>

<h3>canEqual</h3>

<p>
A nice approach to restoring the symmetry of equality was developed for the
programming language Scala. The <code>equals()</code> method is implemented
using a second method <code>canEqual()</code>, whose job is to determine
whether equality is possible <em>from the perspective of the other object</em>.
The specification of <code>canEqual()</code> is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
/** Returns: whether the run-time type of <code>o</code> is compatible
 *  with equality with the receiver object.
 */
boolean canEqual(Object o);
</pre>
<p>
In the above example of the interface <code>Point</code> with two implementing
classes, we would implement <code>equals()</code> as follows for
<code>CartesianPoint</code>, by adding a test of <code>canEqual()</code>:
<pre>
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof Point p) {
            return (o.canEqual(this) && x == p.x() && y == p.y());
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
To achieve Leibniz equality, different implementations of <code>Point</code>
then provide a <code>canEqual()</code> method that only tests whether this
object is a point:
</p>
<pre>
    boolean canEqual(Object o) {
        return (o instanceof Point);
    }
</pre>
<p>
On the other hand, if class <code>Point</code> has a subtype
<code>ColoredPoint</code> whose observer <code>color()</code> can be used to
distinguish two differently colored points, the class <code>ColoredPoint</code> can override <code>canEqual()</code>
to prevent non-colored points from being equal to colored points, regardless
of the order in which the comparison is made:
<pre>
    // In ColoredPoint.equals()
    boolean canEqual(Object o) {
        return (o instanceof ColoredPoint);
    }
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof ColoredPoint) {
            return (o.canEqual(this) &&
                    x == o.x() && y == o.y() && color() == o.color())
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
A ColoredPoint is not equal to a CartesianPoint because the point does not pass the <ocde>instanceof</code>
test in <code>ColoredPoint.equals()</code>; a CartesianPoint will not be equal to a
<code>ColoredPoint</code> because the CartesianPoint does not pass the <code>instanceof</code> test in
<code>ColoredPoint.canEqual()</code>.
</p>

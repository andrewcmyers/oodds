<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Topics covered here include object-oriented programming, program
    structure and organization, program reasoning using specifications and
    invariants, recursion, data structures, sorting and graph algorithms,
    asymptotic complexity, and simple algorithmic analysis, design patterns,
    concurrent programming, graphical user interfaces and event-driven programming.
    Java is the programming language used, and the reader is expected to have some
    prior programming experience, though not necessarily in Java.

    on GitHub. Future planned improvements include more introductory material on
    programming in Java, and integration of exercises for the reader.

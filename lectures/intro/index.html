<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
These are course notes originally created for Computer Science 2112 at Cornell University.
</p>
<p>
Topics covered in these notes include object-oriented programming, program
structure and organization, program reasoning using specifications and
invariants, recursion, design patterns, concurrent programming, graphical user
interfaces, data structures, sorting and graph algorithms, asymptotic
complexity, and simple algorithm analysis. Java is the programming
language used, and students are expected to have some prior programming
experience, though not necessarily in Java.

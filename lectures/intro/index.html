<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
One of the joys of working with computers is that it is relatively easy to
create new things. We can have a creative new idea about an application or
functionality, and produce software that makes that idea real and useful in
a matter of days. The constraints of the real world weigh much less heavily
on software developers than on engineers in other disciplines.
</p>
<p>
But what skills and knowledge do we need in order to make this rapid creation
possible? Of course, we need to understand how to use a programming language
to write code, and this text is written under the assumption that the reader
has done some programming. To build complex software, however, we need more
than just the ability to write code. We need to understand what algorithms and
data structures are available to solve problems efficiently. We need to be
expert in using the programming language to express the desired functionality.
We need to know how to break apart a large programming problem into smaller
problems that are less daunting. And for our code to be truly useful, it needs
to be written in a way that makes it easy to maintain and improve over time.
These are the topics covered here.
</p>

<h2>Overview of topics</h2>

<h3>Programming Language Features</h3>
<p>
An important part of being a good software engineer is the ability to
effectively use the features of the programming language being used.  Modern
programming languages have many features that can be used effectively to write
clearer, simpler, and more efficient code, or misused to write complex code
that is hard to maintain. This book is written using Java as the programming
language.
While Java is a popular language, it
is far from the only programming language used in practice.
Fortunately, most of the lessons we learn from understanding how to use Java
will carry over to other programming languages.
</p>
<p>
Like many popular programming languages, Java is object-oriented, so
object-oriented programming (OOP) is a key topic. However, OOP is actually a
harmonious collection of related ideas that we will carefully explore.  Java
also supports other important features such as generics and concurrent
programming, and we will see how to use these features as well.
</p>

<h3>Modular software design</h3>
<p>
Object-oriented languages were designed to support the construction
of complex software systems. A major focus of this text is how to
organize large programs, by breaking them up into separate code
modules that make it easier to design and implement. We will also
explore programming paradigms like concurrent and event-driven programming,
talk about how to design and program user interfaces using graphical
user interface frameworks, and learn about design patterns that can help
us organize code.
</p>

<h3>Algorithms and data structures</h3>

<p>
To write efficient code, a software developer needs to choose how to represent
information in data structures and pick the right algorithms.  Fortunately,
computer scientists have been studying these problems for decades, and have
developed many useful algorithms and data structures. Algorithms can be
tricky to get right, especially when coded for maximum efficiency, so we
will also need to reason carefully about the correctness and
efficiency of algorithms, using techniques like mathematical induction and
asumptotic complexity. We will see how to apply these intellectual
tools to a variety of important data structures, including
arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, and to
algorithms that operate on them.
</ul>

<h2>A Motivating Example</h2>
<p>
To illustrate how the content of this text may be helpful,
let us consider an example. Suppose that we want to build a
simple game.
One classic puzzle that you may have seen is the 15-puzzle, introduced
by famous puzzle designer Sam Loyd. This puzzle has 15 numbered tiles
within a 4 by 4 grid. There is one empty space, so tiles can be slid into the
empty space to rearrange them. The goal is to arrange the titles in sorted
order starting from the upper left. The puzzle is shown below in a possible
initial unsolved configuration.

</div>

<p>
Suppose that we want the final version of the app to support hints to the user
about what move to make next, and even some automatic solving capability.
</p>

<p>
The problem of designing this application raises many questions. In
an object-oriented languages, we probably want to represent the state
of the puzzle as an object. What operations should puzzle objects have?
What data is stored inside puzzle objects to represent the state
of the puzzle?
Can we write the code for the 15-puzzle in a way that lets us reuse
the code for a similar game, such as <a href="https://play2048.co/">the 2048 game</a>?
What is the right user interface for the application,
one that presents the right information to the user and gives them the
ability to interact efficiently and enjoyably with it?
</p>
<p>
The application also raises questions about data structures and algorithms.
Efficient algorithms are especially important for automatic
suggestions and automatic solving, because the software needs to be able
to explore many possible sequences of moves.
</p>

<h2>Puzzles as graphs</h2>

<p>
Developing algorithms for the 15-puzzle is made much easier if we
recognize that it is an example of an important computer science
abstraction: a <b>graph</b>.
</p>
<p>
Imagine we could draw all of the possible states of the 15-puzzle
on a sheet of paper. We'd need a truly huge sheet of paper because
there are so many possible states of the puzzle. From each of these
possible states there are 2, 3, or 4 possible moves that can be
made, depending on the position of the empty space into which tiles
can be slid.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider the puzzle configuration shown at the center
of the following diagram. In this state, there are four possible
moves, as indicated by the four outgoing arrows labeled N, S, E, and W for
the points of the compass. Making one of these moves results in the
state that the arrow leads to, from which additional moves can be
made. For example, after making an N move, you can make an S move
to get back to the original state.

<p>
The problem of solving the 15-puzzle is the problem of finding a path
through this diagram until the solved state is reached. Fortunately,
this is a problem that computer scientists have though about a great deal,
though not specifically in the context of the 15-puzzle. Instead, a
computer scientist might view this problem as the more general problem
for finding a path through a <b>graph</b>. A graph is a mathematical
structure comprising a set of <b>vertices</b> (or <b>nodes</b>), connected
by a set of <b>edges</b>. To view the diagram above as a graph, we
consider the puzzle states to be the vertices of the graph and the
moves between the states to be the edges of the graph.
</p>
<p>
The value of seeing this problem as a graph is that graphs have been
studied for centuries by mathematicians and computer scientists, and
there is a huge toolbox of problem-solving techniques that we can
draw upon.
</p>
<p>
Graphs can be used to solve many problems, because many problems can be
represented as graphs. Other examples of graphs include airline routes,
roadmaps, organization charts, pipelines, and family trees, and the
algorithms
</p>
<h3>Connectedness</h3>
<p>
One interesting property of graphs is whether they are <b>connected</b>:
that is, whether there is a path to any given vertex from any other.
Perhaps surprisingly, the graph of 15-puzzle states is <em>not</em>
connected: rather, it consists of two separate sets of states that
are not reachable from each other. The graph for the 15-puzzle is too large to
show these <b>connected components</b> directly, but a scaled-down 2×2 version
of the 15-puzzle (which we might call a 3-puzzle) is small enough that we can
see all the states. The 3-puzzle has 4 locations for tiles, so there are
4×3×2×1 = 24 possible states, shown in the following diagram with 
blue arrows representing all legal moves again connecting states.

<p>
Clearly, if the puzzle looks like any of the bottom states in the diagram,
there is no way to solve the puzzle, because the solution state in the upper
left cannot be reached by any sequence of moves.

<h3>Other graph problems</h3>

<p>
Depending on the problem we want to solve, a graph representation of the 
problem may allow us to use many other algorithms:

<ul>
<li><b>Search algorithms</b> find the best paths through a graph, or the paths to
the best nodes in a graph, according to some notion of best. They can also
be used to determine connectness of graphs.
<li>When edges in a graph represent the ability to carry some material
from one point to another, <b>maximum-flow algorithms</b> find the maximum
carrying capacity of the graph.
<li><b>Minimum spanning trees</b> choose the best set of edges to ensure that
a graph is fully connected.
</ul>
<p>
We see some of these algorithms later on.
</p>
<p>
It is also useful to know when a problem is <em>too hard</em> to solve. For
example, consider the problem of finding a path through a graph that visits
each vertex once and ends back at the start vertex. Such a path is called a
<b>Hamiltonian cycle</b>. Such paths can be found for small graphs, but no
efficient algorithm is known for solving this problem in general! Nor should we
bet on such an algorithm being discovered, because if an efficient algorithm
were found, it would allow us to solve a number of other seemingly intractable
problems that scientists have been struggling with for decades. If you can show
that your problem is as hard as finding Hamilonian cycles, it is time to change
what you are working on!

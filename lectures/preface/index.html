<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
    This online book is intended to support a second-semester computer science
    course, one that focuses on material that would be useful to a professional
    software developer. It explores how to use object-oriented programming to
    effectively build complex code, including ideas from software engineering
    “in the small.” It also covers many basic algorithms and data structures,
    using them to develop a stronger foundation for thinking about correctness
    and performance. The reader is expected to have some basic familiarity with
    programming, and to feel comfortable with concepts such as variables,
    functions, arrays, and loops. The book uses Java as the programming
    language, but the reader's prior experience does not need to be with Java.
    At the same time, it is not intended to offer comprehensive coverage
    of Java features.

<p>
    Topics covered here include object-oriented programming, program
    structure and organization, program reasoning using specifications and
    invariants, recursion, data structures, sorting and graph algorithms,
    asymptotic complexity, and simple algorithmic analysis, design patterns,
    concurrent programming, graphical user interfaces and event-driven programming.

<p>
    While all of the chapters can be printed out, the book is intended to be
    primarily an online document. Many of the figures include helpful
    animations that obviously do not work when printed out. Further, there are
    integrated, interactive exercises for the reader.

    The material in this book was developed as part of teaching two courses
    at Cornell, CS 2112 and CS 2110. Many people have contributed to the
    development of these courses.

    This material is a work in progress, and the <a

    on GitHub. Future planned improvements include more introductory material
    on programming in Java, and integration of exercises for the reader.
